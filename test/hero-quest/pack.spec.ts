/**
 * Enemy packs (`classes-and-combat.md` §7).
 *
 * The load-bearing spec is the first one: **at pack size 1 every function reproduces the
 * single-enemy model exactly.** Packs were introduced so AoE, chain and taunt abilities have
 * targets, not to reprice the game, so the size-1 path has to stay bit-identical — it is the
 * control against which every pack result is read.
 *
 * Wave and elite encounters are homogeneous; boss encounters are the boss plus an escort, and
 * are the first genuinely mixed pack in the game.
