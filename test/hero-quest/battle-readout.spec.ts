/**
 * What the battle screen draws, and where it thinks the run has got to.
 *
 * Two halves, matching the module. `projectRun` walks the run forward from a payload — kills,
 * stage, world, XP, level — and `battleReadout` turns where it landed into bars.
 *
 * The projection half exists because the screen was a minute-old photograph: the stage counter
 * filled and then sat at 30/30, the world and stage never moved until the poll landed, and the XP
 * bar was frozen the whole time. The specs that matter most here are the ones pinning that the
 * client's walk is the *same* walk `settle()` does — stage rollover, the boss gate that stops it,
 * and the wave wall that restarts instead of clearing. A client that advanced past a gate the
 * server parks at would be lying about where the player is.
 *
 * The readout half comes from the session-1 playtest: the Hero HP bar never moved, the enemy HP
 * figure disagreed with the bar beside it, and the pack count never came down. The fix was to
 * derive every readout from one quantity, so the bars cannot disagree.
