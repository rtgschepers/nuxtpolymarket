/**
 * Free 10-pull entitlements (session-1 playtest, finding 3).
 *
 * Two halves, and they are tested very differently on purpose:
 *
 * - `freePullState` is pure and is the *only* place availability is decided. The server enforces
 *   with it and the client counts down against it, so a bug here is a bug in both at once — which
 *   is exactly why it is worth this many specs.
 * - The route half is a **concurrency** question, not a logic one. An entitlement is value, so
 *   the only interesting question is what happens when two claims race, and that needs a real
 *   database and a real row lock.
 *
 * The DB half needs the local Postgres from .env. Skips when DATABASE_URL is unset.
