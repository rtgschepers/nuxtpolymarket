/**
 * The wiki glossary (session-1 playtest, finding 6).
 *
 * The wiki's whole claim is that **it cannot go stale**: prose describes shape, and every number
 * is interpolated from `constants.ts`. That claim is only as good as the next person who edits a
 * formula string, and typing `1%` instead of `${CRIT_CHANCE_PER_POINT * 100}%` would look
 * identical on screen the day it was written and be silently wrong after the tuning pass.
 *
 * So these specs check the formulas against the live constants. If a constant moves and a
 * formula does not move with it, this fails — which is the only way the "cannot go stale"
 * property is actually enforced rather than merely intended.
 *
 * The content-reference half of the wiki needs no spec here: it is a `v-for` over the content
 * modules, and `content.spec.ts` already owns those rosters' invariants.
