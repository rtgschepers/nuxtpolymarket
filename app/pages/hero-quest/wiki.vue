/**
 * The wiki (session-1 playtest, finding 6).
 *
 * Two halves, on purpose:
 *
 * - **The explainer** — Basics, Combat, Economy, Gacha. Hand-written prose about how the game
 *   works, with every *number* interpolated from `constants.ts` rather than typed out.
 * - **The reference** — Content. Rendered straight from the content modules, so a roster edit
 *   updates it and nobody has to remember to.
 *
 * That split is the whole design. A hand-maintained wiki over ~99 constants that are still being
 * tuned and six rosters that are still being authored would be wrong within a week; one that is
 * *generated* cannot say anything the code does not.
 *
 * What generation cannot fix is prose that describes a mechanic which later changes shape. So the
 * prose deliberately describes *shape* — "a clamped ratio, not a curve" — and leaves magnitudes
 * to the interpolated formulas.
