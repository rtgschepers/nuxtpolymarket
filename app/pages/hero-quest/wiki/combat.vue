      <p>
        Damage is Power, reduced by however much of it the defender's armour stops, times whatever
        the ability is worth. Mitigation is a <strong class="text-default">clamped ratio</strong> —
        it reaches exactly 100% and stops, rather than curving toward immunity forever.
      </p>
      <HeroQuestWikiFormula
        label="Mitigation"
        :formula="`min(100%, DEF ÷ (PWR × ${K}))`"
        :note="`At ${K}× the attacker's Power in Defence, mitigation is total — and a total mitigation still lets ${MIN_DAMAGE} through.`"
      />
      <HeroQuestWikiFormula
        label="Damage"
        :formula="`max(${MIN_DAMAGE}, PWR × (1 − mitigation) × ability multiplier)`"
        :note="`The floor is why a wall slows you down instead of stopping you dead. An attacker with no Power is the exception — it deals nothing at all.`"
      />
      <p>
        On a crit, the finished hit is multiplied again by your crit multiplier. Luck decides how
        often that happens and Impact decides what it is worth, which is why either one alone is a
        trap.
      </p>
    </HeroQuestWikiSection>

    <HeroQuestWikiSection
      title="Why a party is worth more than its damage"
      icon="i-lucide-users"
    >
      <p>
        Each unit swings its own Power — but the party
        <strong class="text-default">pools all of it</strong> to decide how much armour it cuts
        through. Mitigation is computed once, against the sum.
      </p>
      <p>
        The consequence is worth understanding: a Champion far weaker than your Hero still thins
        the enemy's armour for everyone, so it adds more than its own damage. This is what makes
        party size move how deep you can go, rather than just how fast you clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Incoming damage works the other way — it is worked out per defender. Adding bodies does
        not quietly make you tankier.

    >
      <p>
        A single-target attacker chews through the <strong class="text-default">front row
        first</strong>, and only reaches the back once the front is empty or dead. That is the
        entire mechanical basis of the Tank archetype — a Tank in the back row is a Tank doing
        nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within a row, whoever draws the most threat is hit first. Tanks generate more of it, and a
        taunt generates far more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every unit has a suggested row it starts in, and every one of them can be moved.

        At zero Speed everyone attacks once every {{ BASE_ATTACK_INTERVAL_SECONDS }} seconds.
        Speed shortens that and shortens skill cooldowns on the same curve, both clamped at a
        floor — so Speed is worth a great deal early and very little late.

      <p>
        Evasion is the one stat you cannot build directly: nothing in this build grants it, and it
        is capped regardless so that no amount of it makes anything untouchable.
