        Not every stage is the same. Most are ordinary waves. Stage
        {{ BOSS_STAGE }} is a boss, stages {{ ELITE_STAGE_MIN }}–{{ ELITE_STAGE_MAX }} are elites
        with tougher stats, and stage {{ SUPER_BOSS_STAGE }} is a super boss guarding the way into
        the next world.

      <p>
        Waves clear themselves wherever you are. A boss only fights while this page is actually
        open in front of you — it engages on its own a moment after your hero reaches the gate,
        and it stops the instant you switch tabs or close the app. That is deliberate: it is the
        one gate that <em>cannot</em> be passed while you are away. You can always engage it
        yourself rather than waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        A boss fight is resolved in full the moment you engage, on the server, from the stats you
        have right then. What you watch afterwards is a replay of a fight that already happened —
        nothing you do during it changes the outcome. If the timer runs out with the boss alive,
        you lose nothing but the attempt; go get stronger and come back.

        The game does not run a clock for you in the background. It works out what happened the
        next time you look, from how long you were gone. If the gap since your last check-in is
        under {{ minutesOnline }} minutes you count as <strong class="text-default">present</strong>
        and earn the full rate. A longer gap is treated as offline time, which is both capped and
        taxed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both limits are prestige-shop tracks, and they are the reason to spend early Void Shards
        there rather than on party slots.

        Clearing World {{ WORLD_COUNT }}, Stage {{ SUPER_BOSS_STAGE }} unlocks prestige. It returns
        you to World 1 Stage 1 against a harder curve, and pays

        at prestige without losing a level.

        Every skill on every unit fires the instant its cooldown ends — yours, your Champions',
        the enemy's. There is no cast button, no queue and no ready-and-waiting state anywhere in
        the game. Equipping a skill is a build decision, not an input you have to keep making.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two things that <em>do</em> want you present are engaging bosses and spending what you
        have earned.
