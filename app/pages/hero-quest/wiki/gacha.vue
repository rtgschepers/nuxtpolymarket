        Gear, Champions, Skills and Artifacts each have their own Seals, their own Essence and
        their own level — but the rarity ladder, drop table, duplicate curve and crafting rules
        are the same in all four. There is nothing extra to learn when you open a new one.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is <strong class="text-default">no pity counter</strong>, and that is not an
        oversight. Duplicates are the progression: they level the copy you already own, and once
        it is maxed they convert to Essence you can spend on exactly the item you wanted. A bad
        streak is slower, never wasted.

        Both Essence columns climb five-fold per tier, which means a maxed Mythic's duplicates are
        worth a great deal — but crafting one costs five times what the tier below does. Essence
        never crosses between gachas.

        Pulling raises the gacha's level, and the level shifts the whole drop table toward the top
        rarities. It counts <strong class="text-default">pulls, not Seals</strong>, so nothing you
        do can advance it faster or slower than the pulls you make.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exact odds at every level are on the gacha page — tap the
        <UIcon

      <p>
        A new copy arrives at 0★ Level 1. Duplicates bank toward the next level; ten levels make a
        star; the star resets the level and the climb continues. One number describes how far a
        copy has come — <strong class="text-default">star × 10 + level</strong> — and that same
        number is what scales its stats, its effect magnitudes and its passive contribution.

      />
      <p>
        Past the top, duplicates stop being wasted and start being Essence. That conversion is the
        reason there is no pity: a fully maxed collection turns every future pull into crafting
        currency.

      <p>
        Essence buys a specific item outright — no roll involved. It comes from one source only:
        duplicates of a copy you have already maxed. That makes crafting the far end of the
        collection loop rather than a parallel path, and it is why the price rises so steeply with
        rarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crafting something you already own levels it instead, so Essence is never dead weight.

        Owning is not the same as equipping, and the four systems differ here:

      <ul class="space-y-1.5 list-disc pl-5">
        <li>
          <strong class="text-default">Gear</strong> has six slots, one per stat, all open from
          the start. The first piece you ever get for a slot equips itself; after that, swapping
          is always your call — watch for the <em>Upgrade</em> badge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="text-default">Champions</strong> fill party slots, which you buy with
          Void Shards. Un-fielded Champions still buff your Hero.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="text-default">Skills</strong> fill skill slots and fire on their own. No
          duplicate slotting — level the one copy instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="text-default">Artifacts</strong> are party-wide passives. Nothing caps
          how many share a category, and there are no set bonuses to chase.
