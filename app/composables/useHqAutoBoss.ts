/**
 * Fires the boss for you while the tab is visible.
 *
 * The decision is `shouldAutoEngage`, which is pure and specced; this is only the wiring — a
 * `visibilitychange` listener, a clock counting how long the projection has held the gate, and
 * the one call. Everything it needs is handed in, so the page keeps owning the request.
 *
 * ## Rejections are expected, and silent
 *
 * `boss/engage.post.ts` settles and then re-checks the position under its lock, so an engage the
 * client sent a beat early comes back 400 "The run is not at a boss gate". That is the client
 * having run ahead of the server, not a failure the player did anything about, so it is swallowed
 * and retried rather than toasted. `AUTO_ENGAGE_GRACE_KILLS` is what makes it rare; this is what
 * makes it harmless when it happens anyway.
 *
 * Any *other* error is left to the caller's own handling — a 401 or a 500 is a real problem and
 * should surface.
