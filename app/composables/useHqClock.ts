/**
 * One ticking clock for every Hero Quest countdown on screen.
 *
 * The gacha hub shows four free-pull timers at once, and four components each running their own
 * `setInterval` is four wakeups a second to render the same value. This is one interval shared by
 * however many subscribers exist, torn down when the last one unmounts.
 *
 * Module-scope on purpose. It holds nothing but the wall clock — no user state — so the usual
 * objection to module-level refs in an SSR app (leaking one request's data into another's) does
 * not apply, and the interval itself only ever starts in `onMounted`, which is client-only.
 *
 * **It drives labels, never decisions.** Every countdown here is cosmetic: the server decides
 * whether a free pull is owed, re-checking under a row lock with the same pure function, so a
 * client whose clock is wrong gets a 400 rather than a free pull.
