 *
 * The card data has 24 distinct `foilEffect` values and they do not agree on
 * much: SunBeam is a broad diagonal sweep, SwHolo is a fine vertical comb in a
 * narrow green slice, FlatSilver is metallic rather than coloured. Most map to
 * no texture at all — the game ships only six — so "has a pattern" says nothing
 * useful about how an effect should be drawn.
 *
 * Each entry below sets defaults for the uniforms; anything absent keeps the
 * uniform's own default, and any URL parameter still wins over both. `verified`
