// The Hero, all sixteen class nodes (asset-list §1.1: fully unique per node, 6 states each).
//
// Every class is the same chibi rookie re-outfitted (chibi.ts): one face throughout, and what
// changes per node is the Look (outfit, weapon, headgear) and every keyframe of Idle, Basic
// Attack, Skill cast, Hit and Death. Tier shows in the gear: base classes are novices in
// hand-me-downs, elites are specialised, masters are unmistakable at a glance.
//
// The classes live one file per line (heroes-warrior.ts, heroes-mage.ts, heroes-archer.ts),
// built from the shared kit in hero-kit.ts. The sixth state, Move, is derived here.
