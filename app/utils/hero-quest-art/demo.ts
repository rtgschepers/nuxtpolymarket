// A live battle vignette built from the finished assets — the proof that they play together.
//
// Party on the left (the Hero in any class plus five Champions), and on the right whichever wave
// the viewer picked (`WaveKind`), fought over and over: six of the chosen world's trash with an
// elite among them, the world's boss, or its super boss, each making its entrance. Both sides stand on the 3 front / 3 back formation grid, which the
// side-on camera shows as three ranks of two. Each unit runs the state machine the art is
// authored for:
//
//     IDLE → CHARGE → CAST → RECOVER → IDLE
//
// with the hit landing at the Cast boundary (the clip's `impact`), or, for a ranged unit, when
// its arrow or bolt arrives. Hits spawn pooled particles and damage numbers; Hero and Champion
// casts play their ability VFX.
//
// Two clocks, after Pixel Crusade: bodies play their held 10 fps frames, while everything that
// flies (projectiles, particles, VFX, shake) and the scenery move at the 60 Hz of the loop.
//
// The hit feel is scaled to a crowd. Twelve bodies trading blows would stutter the whole
// scene if every hit froze it, so an ordinary hit only holds the two bodies involved for a
// few ticks, and the target flashes and jolts. The scene-wide freeze, shake, flash and slow
// motion are kept for the moments that matter: a kill (gated, so a chain of kills can't
// freeze it over and over), each impact of a Hero skill, the last kill of a wave, and a boss.
// See JUICE. The dead shatter into their own pixels; bodies winding up are rim-lit in their
// accent colour, and casters leave afterimages.
//
// A boss with a special opens with it and uses it again each time its cooldown is up, presented
// like a Hero skill turned on the party: the scene tinted, everyone else holding, its hits landing
// on its own clock. In a fight the log says when (`enemy_special`), and the hits land the log's
// numbers. Skills and specials put up no name; a boss's own name goes up in the banner halfway
// through its entrance.
//
// Between waves the party marches: it holds its marks and plays its gait while the scenery
// parallax-scrolls past and the next wave closes in from the right edge.
//
// Every body is baked to frames at setup, so the 60 Hz update and the render allocate nothing:
// the loop only moves numbers and blits surfaces. The scene and the VFX are drawn live each
// frame instead, under the smooth clock (`clock.smooth`): a baked strip is fixed at scroll 0
// and on the 10 fps grid, and neither could parallax or move at 60 Hz.
