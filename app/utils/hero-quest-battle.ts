/**
 * What the battle screen shows, projected forward from one server payload.
 *
 * Two functions, in order. `projectRun` walks the run forward from the last payload — kills,
 * stage, world, Gold, XP, level — and `battleReadout` turns the position it lands on into bars.
 * Everything on screen is a function of the one quantity `projectRun` accrues, so nothing on
 * screen can disagree with anything else on it.
 *
 * ## Why the client is allowed to do this at all
 *
 * `settle()` is the authority and this is not a second one. What makes the projection safe is
 * that it is the *same walk*, over the same pure helpers (`killsRequired`, `nextStage`,
 * `goldPerKill`, `xpPerKill`, `applyXp`, `offlineFarmStage`), against a rate the server handed
 * over. The next payload overwrites all of it. No projected number is ever sent back, and
 * nothing here decides anything — `docs/games/hero-quest/CLAUDE.md` §3, server authority.
 *
 * ## The one rate
 *
 * `secondsPerKill` and `killsBeforeWipe` come from the payload and are held for the whole
 * projection, including across a stage or world boundary. That is not an approximation the
 * client invented: `settle()` does exactly the same thing, deliberately ("offline holds one
 * rate… a window that carries the run into deeper stages fights all of them at the departure
 * stage's difficulty"). Holding them is what keeps the projection and the settle in agreement;
 * recomputing them would make the screen disagree with the server it is drawing.
 *
 * Position-only quantities are a different case and are **not** held — pack size, per-enemy HP
 * and pack HP depend on nothing but `RunPosition`, so `battleReadout`'s caller recomputes them
 * exactly from the projected position rather than showing World 3's HP total on World 4.
 *
 * Pure, and separate from the components, because the edge cases are worth pinning: a pack
 * rolling over, a party the server calls undying, a walled stage that restarts instead of
 * clearing, a boss gate that stops the walk, and a `secondsPerKill` of zero or null.
