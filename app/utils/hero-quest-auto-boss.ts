/**
 * Whether a boss should fire on its own right now.
 *
 * Pure, and its own module, because "did we just re-fight the final boss for the ninetieth time"
 * is not a thing anyone should have to discover by watching a screen. Every reason to hold is a
 * named case with a spec against it.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * A boss engages automatically while `document.visibilityState` reads `visible`. That is the same
 * presence `HQ_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS` demonstrates, so the design invariant is untouched: a
 * backgrounded tab, a closed app and an offline settle still never engage a boss, and Void Shards
 * still cannot be earned from idle time alone (`idle-mechanics.md` §5).
 *
 * ## Why it is not simply "at a gate and visible"
 *
 * Three things have to be true beyond that, and each of them is a real failure someone would
 * otherwise hit:
 *
 * 1. **The run must not already be cleared.** `nextStage` is a fixed point at World 10 Stage 10,
 *    so a won super boss leaves the run parked on the same gate with `runCleared` set. Firing
 *    there would re-fight the final boss forever, and every win pays Milestone Seals. Manual
 *    re-engage has the same shape and predates this — flagged, not fixed here.
 * 2. **The projection must have held the gate for `AUTO_ENGAGE_GRACE_KILLS`.** The client counts
 *    kills fractionally and the server floors, so the screen reaches a gate up to one kill before
 *    the server agrees. See `AUTO_ENGAGE_GRACE_KILLS`.
 * 3. **Nothing may already be in flight or on screen.** One engage at a time, and never while a
 *    replay is still playing.
