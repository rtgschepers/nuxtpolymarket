/**
 * The glossary the wiki and every info tooltip read from (session-1 playtest, finding 6:
 * "a new player currently has no idea what each skill or stat means").
 *
 * **One definition per concept, in one place.** A tooltip on the battle screen and a wiki entry
 * describing the same stat differently is worse than having neither, because the player cannot
 * tell which one is out of date. Both render from these tables.
 *
 * **Every number is interpolated from `constants.ts`, never typed out.** That is the whole
 * reason this is a module rather than prose in a template: roughly a hundred of those constants
 * are still `// UNTUNED ╧` and will move during the tuning pass, and a wiki that quietly keeps
 * quoting the old value is worse than no wiki. Prose describes *shape*; numbers come from the
 * source of truth or are not stated.
 *
 * What this cannot do is know *which* constants are still untuned — that lives in a comment, not
 * in a value. The wiki says so once, prominently, rather than pretending to a precision it
 * does not have.
