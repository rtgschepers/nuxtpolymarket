/**
 * The battle, drawn. Presentation only: the projected run (`useHqLiveRun`) says where the run is,
 * and the stage plays it, every body dropping when `killsFloat` crosses its kill.
 *
 * A boss fight is the server's: while `fight` is set the stage stops following the run and acts
 * out the fight's log instead, reporting how far it has played so the readout beside it keeps
 * pace. Clearing `fight` hands the stage back to the run, which by then has moved on.
 *
 * The stage is also the game's navigation: a band of icons under it opens the menu scenes.
 * An open scene draws over the battle, which plays on unseen beneath it, so closing the scene
 * shows the battle where it has got to rather than rebuilding it.
 *
 * The art is drawn from code, not loaded as images (`build-log.md` #33): the stage bakes the
 * world's strips when it is built, so it is rebuilt only when the world or the party changes,
 * and fed the run every frame otherwise. The engine is loaded on mount, as its own chunk, so no
 * other page carries the drawers.
