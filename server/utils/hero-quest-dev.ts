/**
 * The Hero Quest playtest harness — **development only, never shipped.**
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `implementation-plan.md` Phase 1 ends with "**Stop here and actually play it before
 * continuing.**" That has now been deferred twice, and roughly 99 constants carry
 * `// UNTUNED ╧` waiting on the play data it would produce. The obstacle is not willingness —
 * it is that Hero Quest is an idle game measured in days. The campaign sim puts two prestiges
 * at three and a half days of wall clock, the free Seal grant is on a 24-hour timer, and the
 * Gold ladder resets on a date key. An evening of honest play reaches World 2.
 *
 * This collapses that. It is the difference between "we should playtest sometime" and
 * "playtest the offline cap right now, in a minute".
 *
 * ## The one design rule here
 *
 * **Never reimplement game math.** Every function below moves *inputs* — the clock, a currency
 * balance, a run position, an owned row — and then lets the production code path do the work.
 * `devSkip` in particular does not compute what eight hours would have earned; it rewinds
 * `lastSettledAt` and calls the real `settleHq`. A harness that models the game separately is a
 * harness that lies to you about the game, which is worse than no harness at all.
 *
 * ## The gate
 *
 * `assertDevHarness` throws a **404**, not a 403, so in production these routes are
 * indistinguishable from routes that were never deployed.
 *
 * It reads `import.meta.dev` and **deliberately does not honour the `devMode` runtime config**
 * that `server/api/pathwarden/*` accepts alongside it. That flag is a deploy-time toggle, and
 * these routes mint Gold and Gems — which are shared balances across every polynux game, not
 * Hero Quest's own scrip. A dev harness for one game must not become a mint for the platform,
 * so the gate is the build mode alone and nothing that can be flipped in a running deployment.
 *
 * ## Scope, deliberately
 *
 * `devReset` clears Hero Quest's five tables and **does not touch `balance` or `gems`.** Those
 * belong to the platform; a game reset has no business zeroing a balance the player may have
 * earned in Cyber or the Bank. The asymmetry with `devGrant` is intentional — granting into a
 * shared balance is a dev convenience, silently deleting from one is data loss.
