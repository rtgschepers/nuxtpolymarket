/**
 * Feature unlocks and the guide's tutorials on the server (`shared/utils/hero-quest/tutorials.ts`).
 *
 * The unlocks are a gate, not only a hidden button: every route that acts for a feature asks
 * `requireFeature` first, so a client can't reach one early. They are read off the run's position,
 * which only moves forward, so a read a moment stale can only refuse, never let through. A boss
 * lost to counts as fought: `boss_lost` is cleared only by the win that moves the run past it.
