/**
 * The Arena on the server (`arena.md`): the defence, the opponent list, attacks, attempts, the
 * Arena Shop, seasons, the battle log and the Rating leaderboard. The rules are `arena.ts`'s and
 * the fight is `duel.ts`'s; this module only applies them.
 *
 * ## Locks
 *
 * Everything an attack moves sits on `hq_state`: the attacker's attempts, Medals, Rating and list,
 * and the defender's Rating. An attack locks **both** rows, always in user-ID order, so two attacks
 * on the same defender queue on its row and read its Rating fresh, and A attacking B while B
 * attacks A can't deadlock. Every spend (an extra attempt, a refresh) locks its row before it reads
 * a counter and pays with the same `tx`, `hq_state` before `user`, the order `settleHq` takes them in.
 * A shop purchase of Keys writes the raid row before `hq_state`, the order a raid entry takes them in.
 *
 * ## Seasons, with no cron
 *
 * A season ends for everyone at once (`arenaSeasonAt`). Nothing happens at that instant: a row
 * still carrying an old season is rolled to the current one, Rating back to the start, the first
 * time something touches it (`rollStanding`). Before anything may roll a row, the season it leaves
 * must have its final standings written down, so every Arena request first closes the seasons that
 * have ended (`ensureSeasonsClosed`), each in its own short transaction, before taking any row lock.
 * The `hq_arena_seasons` insert is the claim: one request writes a season's standings, every other
 * waits on it and then finds it done. A request reads the clock once, before closing anything, and
 * judges seasons by that same instant, so it never rolls a row out of a season it did not close.
