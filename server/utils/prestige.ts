 * bought, opened, graded, traded and displayed as durable property, and the
 * market prices them across accounts — a binder is closer to an emblem than
 * to a miner rig. Wiping it on ascent would also strand copies mid-grade and
 * empty every binder while leaving the cards themselves behind (they hang off
 * `owner_id`, which this scan never sees), which is the worst of both worlds.

 * through a reset are handled by prestigeBlockers, not by this list.
