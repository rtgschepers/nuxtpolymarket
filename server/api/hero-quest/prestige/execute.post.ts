/**
 * Complete a prestige: pay Void Shards, reset the run, start over harder.
 *
 * Lock-then-read, because the payout depends on the old `prestige` value and there is no
 * flag to conditionally flip that also carries the number. Reading `runCleared` *before*
 * taking the lock would let a burst of concurrent calls each see a cleared run and each get
 * paid; inside the lock, the first one clears the flag and the rest find it false.
 *
 * `runCleared` — not position — is the gate. A win at World 10 / Stage 10 leaves the run
 * standing on that same stage, so position alone cannot tell "beat the game" from "walked up
 * to the final boss", and paying off position would reward merely arriving.
