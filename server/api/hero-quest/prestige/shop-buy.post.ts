/**
 * Buy one level of a prestige-shop track.
 *
 * Claim-then-reward, twice over, and both guards matter:
 *
 * 1. The level bump is a conditional `UPDATE … WHERE level = <what we read>`. Only the
 *    request that finds the row still at that level wins; the rest match nothing and throw
 *    before any currency moves. Integer compare-and-swap is safe here in a way a timestamp
 *    CAS never is (Postgres keeps microseconds, JS `Date` does not).
 * 2. The balance is spent under a guard of its own — the shard read happens *inside* the
 *    `hqState` row lock and is written in the same transaction, and `debitGems` carries its
 *    `gems >= cost` check in its own WHERE clause. Either way two purchases cannot both spend
 *    the same currency.
 *
 * Without the first, N parallel clicks all read level 3 and all pay for level 4. Without the
 * second, two different tracks bought at once could each debit against the same balance.
 *
 * ## Two currencies
 *
 * Every track was Void Shards until Loadouts. `loadouts.md` §3 prices Loadout slots in **Gems**
 * because they add zero combat power on their own — a player with 2 slots can manually re-equip
 * everything a 10-slot player can, just with more taps. Gems are a shared platform balance, so
 * that path goes through `balance.ts` with the transaction threaded, never `user.gems` directly.
