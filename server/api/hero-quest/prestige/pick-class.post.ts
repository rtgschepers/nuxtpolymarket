/**
 * Choose the Hero's class node.
 *
 * Legal picks are any node **already seen** in a past run, or a specialization exactly one
 * tier deeper than the current node (`classes-and-combat.md` §5). "Already seen" is permanent
 * — reaching a node once keeps it pickable forever, and re-picking a deep node restores its
 * whole inherited kit because kits are cumulative.
 *
 * **Level is not touched.** Switching class carries the Hero's full level across; only the
 * spread those levels multiply into changes. That is what makes the picker a build choice
 * rather than a tax, and it is the single easiest invariant here to break by accident.
