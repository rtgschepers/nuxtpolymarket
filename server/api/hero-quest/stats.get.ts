 * kilobytes of nested attribution and the state payload is fetched every
 * `HQ_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS` by every open client; this is opened by hand, occasionally, when
 * somebody wants to know why a number is what it is. Paying for it on the hot path to save a
 * round trip on the cold one is the wrong trade.
 *
 * Settles first like every other read, so the levels it explains are the levels the battle
 * screen is showing rather than the ones from before the window that just accrued.
