/**
 * The one read the client makes.
 *
 * Settles first, always, so every read sees a settled world. Returns derived display values
 * rather than raw rows — it has two consumers (the composable and the AI agent's executor
 * overview) and neither should be re-deriving game math. Decimals go out as strings.
 *
 * All four gacha tabs are served from one call rather than one endpoint each, because they share
 * a settle and three of them read the same `hqCollection` query. Splitting them would mean four
 * settles per page load, and a settle is a write.
