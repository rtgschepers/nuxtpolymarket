/**
 * Set any part of the live loadout — party, formation, Skills, Artifacts, Gear
 * (`tech-architecture.md` §5: "live equip: party/skills/artifacts/gear/formation").
 *
 * **One route for all five components**, and that is not just tidiness. A formation is only valid
 * against a specific party, so accepting those two separately would leave a window where the
 * saved formation references a Champion no longer fielded; row capacity is checked across the
 * whole resulting party, Hero included, which cannot be done without both halves. Once the route
 * has to take two together it may as well take the set a Loadout is defined as — and then
 * `loadout/apply` is the same validation over a saved preset instead of a request body, which is
 * exactly how it is written.
 *
 * Every field is **optional**: omitting one leaves it untouched, so the Forge page can set Gear
 * without knowing anything about the party.
 *
 * No currency moves here, so this is a plain lock-and-validate rather than claim-then-reward. The
 * lock still matters: slot counts are read from the shop and the loadout is written against them,
 * and a concurrent slot purchase would otherwise let a save race past the count it was validated
 * against.
