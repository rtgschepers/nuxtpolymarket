/**
 * Craft a specific item in any of the four gachas with that gacha's Essence — the full RNG
 * bypass (`gacha-shared-system.md` §6).
 *
 * Essence has exactly one source: duplicates that land on an already-maxed copy. That is what
 * makes this the sink at the far end of the collection loop rather than a parallel currency —
 * you can only buy your way to a specific item using the overflow from items you have already
 * finished.
 *
 * **Rarity is not a parameter.** The shared doc frames crafting as picking an item *and* a
 * rarity, but every one of the four systems fixes rarity to identity — a Champion's rarity is
 * part of who it is, a Gear piece's rarity is half its name, an Artifact's decides its effect-line
 * count. So the price is looked up from the target rather than requested. Accepting a rarity here
 * would let a client ask for a Mythic at Common prices.
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 *
 * Claim-then-reward, with the **conditional Essence debit as the guard**. Two concurrent crafts
 * against one craft's worth of Essence would otherwise both read the balance, both pass, and both
 * grant. Only the request whose `WHERE <essence> >= cost` matches gets to write a collection row.
