/**
 * Buy extra Seals for any of the four gachas with Gold, on the daily escalating ladder
 * (`gold-economy.md` §7).
 *
 * The first Seal bought *today* costs `SEAL_LADDER_BASE_GOLD`; each further one that day costs
 * more, at a growth rate calibrated per gacha. The four gachas hold **independent counters
 * behind one shared reset date**, so buying Champion pulls today never moves the price of Skill
 * pulls — a distinction that only started mattering when there were four gachas to confuse.
 *
 * This is the designed Gold sink — the reason banked Gold is worth anything at all, since Gold
 * buys nothing else in the game. The ladder's compounding is the brake, and deliberately a smooth
 * one rather than a wall: §7 accepts that a large banked balance buys a real head start (~3% of a
 * roster even for an absurd one-time injection) rather than capping the day.
 *
 * ## Concurrency — lock-then-read, not claim-then-reward
 *
 * The price *depends on the counter's old value*, and the counter lives inside a jsonb map, so
 * there is no single column to compare-and-swap and no flag to conditionally flip. That makes
 * this the textbook case for pattern B: take the `hqState` row lock, read the counter **inside**
 * the lock, price against it, and write everything in the same transaction. A counter read before
 * the lock is already stale, and two concurrent buys would both price at the base rung.
 *
 * `debit` is threaded with `tx` — mandatory, not stylistic. Without it the Gold write goes out on
 * a second pool connection and deadlocks against the lock this transaction is holding.
