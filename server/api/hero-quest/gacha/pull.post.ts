/**
 * Pull from any of the four gachas — `system` in the body (`tech-architecture.md` §5).
 *
 * **One route, not four.** `gacha-shared-system.md` makes the four deliberately parallel — one
 * rarity ladder, one levelling curve, one drop table, one dupe formula — and
 * `docs/hero-quest/CLAUDE.md` §3 requires that machinery be written once and take `system` as an
 * argument. Only two things genuinely differ per system: which content module resolves a roll,
 * and which two columns hold the balances. `content/registry.ts` covers the first and
 * `SEAL_COLUMN` / `ESSENCE_COLUMN` in the domain layer cover the second, so everything below is
 * identical for all four by construction rather than by four files staying in sync.
 *
 * ## Two ways to pay, one way to pull
 *
 * `free: true` spends one of the day's free 10-pull entitlements instead of Seals. Everything
 * after the payment is byte-identical — same rarity roll, same dupe merge, same level bump, same
 * auto-equip — because a free pull *is* a pull and only the payment differs. That is why this is
 * a branch inside one route rather than a second route: duplicating it would mean two copies of
 * the roll loop, which is precisely what §3's one-route rule exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## Why the whole thing sits inside one transaction
 *
 * A pull reads a balance, reads the gacha level, rolls an outcome, and writes three different
 * things (currency, gacha level/progress, collection rows). Every one of those is a
 * read-then-write, which is the exact shape the platform guidance calls "always a bug" — ten
 * parallel pulls would otherwise all read the same balance, all pass the check, and all pay out.
 *
 * **The payment is the guard, and the two paths guard differently** — see `claimWithSeals`
 * (claim-then-reward, the conditional debit is the mutex) and `claimFreePull` (lock-then-read,
 * because availability is three coupled values and one of them is a timestamp). Either way,
 * nothing downstream runs for a request that did not win the payment.
 *
 * ## Randomness
 *
 * `randomFloat` from the platform CSPRNG, never `Math.random()`: this decides a real payout.
 * Rarity comes from the drop table, then the specific item is a uniform pick within that rarity —
 * the two-step the drop table implies (it weights rarities, not individual items).
