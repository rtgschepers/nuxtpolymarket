/**
 * Stores the run at a round boundary — the only point the game is in a
 * state worth freezing. Called once per completed round.
 *
 * The run must still be armed (the deploy stamped its clock) and the save
 * must be the shape the game writes; the points are stored clamped to the
 * same honesty ceiling the settle will apply. The claimed depth is taken
 * on faith: a pacing-based rejection once froze a real run's checkpoints
 * at round 10, and the settle then credited that stale round — accuracy
 * over strictness here, the wall clock still guards the payout itself.
 *
 * Writes are ordered by the depth they claim, not by a revision counter,
 * so a checkpoint whose response the client never saw does not wedge the
 * slot for the rest of the run. `revision` is still accepted and returned
 * for the client's progress display; it no longer gates the write.
