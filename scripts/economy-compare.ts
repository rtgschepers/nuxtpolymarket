// XENO against COLONY at equal days played — the acceptance gate for any change
// to either economy.
//
// The property this exists to protect: a player who has put the same number of
// days into either game should be earning roughly the same. Comparing them by
// tier index does not work — Colony tops out at Habitat 6 after ~82 days while
// Xeno's T9 is still ~230 days out — so everything here is interpolated onto a
// shared day axis, and Colony deliberately PLATEAUS past Habitat 6 instead of
// being extrapolated into a curve that doesn't exist.
//
// Bands: T3-T7 must land inside 0.4-2.5x of Colony. T8/T9 are allowed up to 6x
// because Colony has run out of stages by then while Xeno is still spending
// hundreds of billions on global upgrades to get there.
//
// Re-run after any change to plant values, item sell values, upgrade ladders,
// habitat requirements or research.
//
// HERO QUEST is checked too, on different terms. Its Gold ceiling is *generated*
// from the two economies above, so it tracks them by construction and there is
// no balance question to ask. What there is, is a staleness question: retune
// Colony or Xeno without regenerating GOLD_TENURE_CEILING and the table silently
// describes an economy that no longer exists. That is what the last section
// catches, and it is the reason this script fails on it.
