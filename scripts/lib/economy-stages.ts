// Shared progression model for the idle economies: XENO, COLONY and HERO QUEST.
//
// The property this exists to protect: at any given number of DAYS PLAYED, the
// two games should pay comparably. Tier index is not a fair axis — Colony's
// Habitat 6 and Xeno's T9 are both "the end", but they are 82 and 121 days
// apart from Habitat 1 and T1 respectively, and the stages in between do not
// line up at all. Everything here is therefore keyed on days-to-reach, and the
// income figures are whole-account (every terrarium slot, every grid tile), not
// per-slot.
//
// scripts/xeno-income.ts, scripts/colony-income.ts, scripts/economy-compare.ts
// and test/economy/cross-game.spec.ts all read the same functions from here so
// they cannot drift apart from each other or from the live constants.
//
// Hero Quest joined late and sits differently: its income is a function of
// account age by construction, so it needs no stage model at all. See the
// HERO QUEST section for why comparing it here is a staleness guard rather
// than a balance check.
