// Polytown research.
//
// A slow side track that runs while the town does. One project at a time, so
// research never competes with the builders for attention — it is the thing
// still ticking over when every crew is busy and there is nothing to click.
//
// Five branches of six, each branch a straight line: a project needs the one
// before it. Times climb from half a day to three days, so finishing the whole
// board takes roughly two months of always having something running, which is
// the same order as growing a town to the top tiers. Effects are deliberately
// small on their own and worth having in aggregate; nothing here doubles
// anything, because research that outweighs a building would make the town
// itself beside the point.
