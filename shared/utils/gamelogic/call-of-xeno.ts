// Call of Xeno — pure game rules.
//
// Deterministic data and maths: weapon stats, the Pack-a-Punch ladder, the
// enemy roster, round scaling, power-ups and the point economy. The three.js
// scene, input and rendering live in the client component; keeping the rules in
// `shared` means they can be unit tested without a DOM or a WebGL context.
//
// Everything that will eventually need to scale with a difficulty setting or a
// permanent upgrade is a function of its inputs, never a branch on global
// state, so those can be threaded through later without reshaping the sim.
