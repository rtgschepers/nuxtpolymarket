 * Free 10-pulls, per gacha, per day — **the only free pulls in the game** (revised 2026-09-16).
 *
 * The time-gated Seal drip that used to sit here is **gone**: a batch of every Seal type every 24
 * hours, banking up to a week, paid whether or not the player ever opened the gacha. It made Seals
 * something a clock handed out rather than something earned or bought, and it stacked with this
 * entitlement so the free allowance arrived through two unrelated mechanisms. Free Seals now come
 * only from progression milestones (below); everything else is bought with Gold, which is what
 * makes the Seal ladder a real choice.
 *
 * A **true entitlement, not Seals**: it must be spent as a 10-pull and cannot be banked or split
 * into singles, because the point is the 10-pull *moment* rather than the pull count.
 *
 * The cooldown gates the gap between claims, so an active player collects all of them inside half
 * an hour and an idle one still finds them waiting. A re-engagement hook on a game whose premise
 * is not having to re-engage — worth watching in play.
 *
 * A gacha gets 30 free pulls per day and no free Seals, ×4 systems. **30 a day is the intended
 * hard ceiling** for a player who never buys Seals — accepted 2026-09-16, not a consequence to
 * repair.
 *
 * **Both are TUNED, and they are a pair.** Their product is the daily free allowance — 30 pulls
 * per gacha — and the cooldown alone decides how long a session has to run to collect it (3 claims
 * 10 minutes apart is ~20 minutes, so one sitting takes the lot; at the old 30 it was an hour and
 * most of it went unclaimed). Raising the count without dropping the cooldown makes the tail of
 * the allowance unreachable in a single session; dropping the cooldown without raising the count
 * just hands the same 2 pulls over faster. Set by decision on the session-1 playtest, not measured
 * on the campaign sim — the sim walks combat and does not model pull cadence, so `sim:hero-quest`
 * has nothing to say about either. Coupled downward to the Seal ladder (`SEAL_LADDER_BASE_GOLD`):
 * free pulls are now the only free supply, so moving them moves how soon Gold-bought Seals matter.
