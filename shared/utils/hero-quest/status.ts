/**
 * Status effects: the shared engine every ability plugs into.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists at all
 *
 * Both ability rosters describe effects that presume a status system — Rising Flame's
 * "re-application stacks", Frostbind's "at max stacks, fully disables", Purify's "removes all
 * debuffs and grants brief debuff immunity", Unraveling Curse's "extends the remaining
 * duration of all debuffs currently active on its target". That last one is decisive: it can
 * only be written against a **queryable, mutable, per-unit registry** of live effects. No
 * design doc defines one, so the data model and every interaction rule below is a decision
 * made here rather than transcribed.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately *not* here
 *
 * No ability references any of this yet. Stage 2 builds the engine; Stage 3 authors the
 * effects onto it. That ordering is what lets the engine be tested on its own terms, and it is
 * why every function here degrades to a no-op on an empty status list — a unit with no
 * statuses must behave exactly as it did before this module existed.
 *
 * ## Where it lives
 *
 * `UnitStats` is built once by `stats.ts` and never mutated — that immutability is what makes
 * the stat pipeline a single pass. Statuses are therefore a **separate mutable layer** that
 * sits alongside a unit rather than inside it, and effective values are resolved by combining
 * the two at the point of use.
 *
 * Pure, like the rest of `shared/`: no DB, no clock, no randomness. Durations advance because
 * a caller hands in an elapsed time.
