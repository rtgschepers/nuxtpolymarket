/**
 * The guide's lines (`tutorials.ts`). **Mossimer** is a snail who keeps the Chronicle: every run
 * any hero has made toward the Void is written into the turns of its shell. When a run is beaten
 * the Void folds the world back to Thornwick Vale and forgets it ever happened, but a snail carries
 * everything it owns, so the Chronicle comes through every prestige intact. That is why it can
 * guide you: it has watched this road walked more times than anyone. Unhurried, warm, a little
 * wry about its pace (the user's call on a snail, 2026-10-09; the name and lore, 2026-10-09).
 *
 * Each tutorial is a few short pages, read one at a time. Nothing numeric is written into a line, so
 * a retuned constant can't leave the guide saying the old number.
 *
 * Display only: saves reference the tutorial IDs, never the text.
