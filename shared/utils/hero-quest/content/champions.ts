/**
 * Champion roster and archetype rules (`champions-guild-gacha.md`).
 *
 * **All 48** — 2 per archetype per rarity across all six rarities, the complete roster §1
 * describes. Phase 2 shipped twelve of these (Common/Rare/Mythic, one per archetype); the
 * remaining 36 landed with the roster fill, which also retired the rarity-folding scaffolding
 * that partial content had required.
 *
 * The roster is **assembled from two tables** rather than written out entry by entry — names
 * and titles in `ROSTER`, ability draws in `ABILITY_SLOTS`. That makes the three structural
 * rules (ability count per rarity, the ≤3 reuse cap, and variety within a rarity) consequences
 * of one shared distribution instead of 48 separate opportunities to break one of them.
 *
 * What is **specified by the doc** and reproduced faithfully: rarity multipliers (§2),
 * ability counts per rarity (§2), default rows (§8.1), autoattack targeting (§8.2), the
 * passive stat mapping (§7), the naming template and its epithet/title pools (§5), the
 * 7-ability starting pool per archetype (§6), and each ability's effect (§6).
 *
 * What is **not specified and is therefore placeholdered**: the per-archetype base stat
 * spread. §2 says outright there is no Champion equivalent of `classes-and-combat.md` §2's
 * table, and that absolute magnitudes are owned by this content pass. They are marked
 * `UNTUNED ╧` and expressed in the same `StatTier` vocabulary the Hero uses, so the two
 * remain comparable and one edit retunes both.
 *
 * Cooldowns stay on the shared placeholder — no doc assigns one to any of the 28, and
 * inventing 28 different values would encode a spread nobody decided.

/**
 * Which pool abilities each of those twelve slots draws, as indices into the archetype's
 * 7-strong pool. Shared by all four archetypes, which is what makes the reuse arithmetic a
 * property of one table rather than of 48 hand-written entries.
 *
 * ## Why this exact distribution
 *
 * Two goals pull against each other. **Variety within a rarity**: the two Champions of the
 * same archetype and rarity should not be the same Champion twice. **Overlap across
 * rarities**: a Common's ability should reappear at higher rarity, so pulling a Mythic never
 * feels like it is *missing* something a Common had.
 *
 * A small pool with heavy reuse is what serves the second goal — counter-intuitively,
 * *expanding* the pool would work against it, because a Common's one ability would be less
 * likely to show up on anything Mythic. So the pool stays at 7 and the cap at 3 uses.
 *
 * The arithmetic: 20 slots (1+1+1+2+2+3, doubled) against a capacity of 21 (7 abilities × 3
 * uses). It fits with exactly one slot spare:
 *
 *     common     {0}     / {1}
 *     uncommon   {2}     / {3}
 *     rare       {4}     / {5}
 *     epic       {0,6}   / {1,2}
 *     legendary  {3,6}   / {4,5}
 *     mythic     {0,1,2} / {3,4,5}
 *
 * Every rarity's pair is disjoint, so no two Champions of the same archetype and rarity share
 * a kit. And **the six abilities that appear at Common, Uncommon or Rare are exactly the six
 * the two Mythics carry** — so nothing a low-rarity Champion can do is missing from the top of
 * the ladder, which was the whole point. Ability 6 is the one the Mythics lack; it lives at
 * Epic and Legendary only, and is the single slot of spare capacity.
 *
 * Use counts land at 3,3,3,3,3,3,2 — inside the cap.
 *
 * **A tension worth knowing about.** §6's design table tiers abilities by rarity: a Support's
 * revive and cleanse are described as the *third* ability a Mythic gets, not a Rare's only
 * one. That cannot hold simultaneously with the two goals above: a 7-ability pool capped at 3
 * uses cannot put the basic abilities on low rarities, mirror the low set onto the Mythics,
 * *and* reserve the exotic abilities for high rarities — the arithmetic runs out. The overlap
 * goal won, so Rare Champions do draw from the back half of the pool. Recorded in
 * `open-items.md`; the levers are the pool size and the reuse cap.
