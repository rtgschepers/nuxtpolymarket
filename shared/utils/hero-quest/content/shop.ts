/**
 * The prestige shop — permanent upgrades, mostly bought with Void Shards.
 *
 * Eleven tracks: the two offline tracks, the five slot tracks the gachas, Loadouts and Traits unlock,
 * and four uncapped stat tracks (PWR, DEF, IMP, VIT) that sink Void Shards forever. What is
 * **not** here, and why:
 *
 * - Raid Key grant-rate tracks belong to Raids — Phase 4.
 * - Gear has **no** slot track at all. All six Forge slots are available from account start
 *   (`gear-equipment.md` §1) — the deliberate exception among the four gachas, because slots map
 *   onto Hero stats that exist from day one rather than a party size that grows.
 * - Kill-count reduction and boss-timer extension have **no formula, no level count and no
 *   magnitude in any document**. Inventing them here would bake a guess into the one system whose
 *   whole job is to be the tuning surface. (A stat multiplier was cut once, `build-log.md` #11.4,
 *   for want of a scope; it came back as the four stat tracks, party-wide, in `open-items.md` #41.)
 *
 * Adding any of them later is content, not code: `hqShopUpgrades` is keyed on an opaque
 * `upgradeId`, so a new track is a new entry in `SHOP_TRACKS` and nothing else.
 *
 * ## Two currencies
 *
 * Loadout slots (`loadouts.md` §3) and Trait save slots (`traits.md` §6) are priced in **Gems** —
 * see `LOADOUT_SLOT_BASE_COST_GEMS` and `TRAIT_SAVE_SLOT_BASE_COST_GEMS` — and everything else in
 * Void Shards. That is why `ShopTrack` carries a `currency` and the buy
 * route branches on it.
