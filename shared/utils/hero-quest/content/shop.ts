/**
 * The prestige shop — permanent upgrades, mostly bought with Void Shards.
 *
 * Six tracks: the two offline tracks and the four slot tracks the gachas and Loadouts each
 * unlock. What is **not** here, and why:
 *
 * - Raid Key grant-rate tracks belong to Raids — Phase 4.
 * - Gear has **no** slot track at all. All six Forge slots are available from account start
 *   (`gear-equipment.md` §1) — the deliberate exception among the four gachas, because slots map
 *   onto Hero stats that exist from day one rather than a party size that grows.
 * - Global stat multipliers, kill-count reduction and boss-timer extension have **no formula,
 *   no level count and no magnitude in any document**. The stat multiplier was in fact *cut*
 *   from the shop outright (`open-items.md` #11.4) rather than specified. Inventing the other
 *   two here would bake a guess into the one system whose whole job is to be the tuning surface.
 *
 * Adding any of them later is content, not code: `hqShopUpgrades` is keyed on an opaque
 * `upgradeId`, so a new track is a new entry in `SHOP_TRACKS` and nothing else.
 *
 * ## Two currencies
 *
 * Loadout slots are priced in **Gems** (`loadouts.md` §3) — see `LOADOUT_SLOT_BASE_COST_GEMS` —
 * and everything else in Void Shards. That is why `ShopTrack` carries a `currency` and the buy
 * route branches on it.
