/**
 * The Forge — Gear roster and effect formulas (`gear-equipment.md`).
 *
 * **The simplest system in the project, and the roster proves it.** 6 slots × 6 rarities = 36
 * pieces, one per cell, every one doing the identical thing at a different magnitude. There is
 * no ability pool, no effect-line table and nothing to author: `gear-equipment.md` §1 names all
 * 36 with one template — `<Rarity Epithet> <Slot Name>` — so the roster below is *generated from
 * two axes* rather than transcribed, and the doc's own name table is reproduced exactly.
 *
 * Three ways Gear is the deliberate exception among the four gachas:
 *
 * 1. **Hero-only** (§1), unlike Artifacts, which are party-wide.
 * 2. **All 6 slots available from account start** (§1) — no 2→5 prestige-shop track, because
 *    slots map onto Hero stats that exist from day one rather than a party size that grows.
 * 3. **Single-stat, magnitude-only, always** (§1) — rarity scales the number and never adds a
 *    second stat, so `RARITY_EFFECT_LINES` does not apply here at all.
 *
 * ## Equipped and unequipped both matter
 *
 * §3 locks **manual** equip with an upgrade indicator, revised from an earlier auto-equip
 * proposal. Every slot holds one chosen piece contributing `equippedBonus`; every *other* owned
 * piece for that slot contributes the much smaller `passiveBonus`, mirroring the Champion
 * collection passive (`champions-guild-gacha.md` §7). The consequence §3 names explicitly: a
 * player who ignores the indicator has lower stats than they have already earned, which is why
 * `upgradeAvailable` below exists — the gap is never hidden, only left for them to close.
