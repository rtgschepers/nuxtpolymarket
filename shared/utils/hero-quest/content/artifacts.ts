/**
 * The Dig-site — Artifact roster and the 33-effect pool (`artifacts-dig-site-gacha.md`).
 *
 * **Party-wide and passive-only** (§1). Every equipped Artifact's effect applies to the whole
 * fielded party — Hero and all active Champions — which is the one thing that distinguishes this
 * system from the other three: Champions *are* the party, Skills are the Hero's own loadout, and
 * Gear is Hero-only equipment. No actives, no cooldowns, no buttons anywhere in here.
 *
 * ## What is doc-specified, and what is not
 *
 * **Specified and reproduced faithfully:** the four categories and their stat domains (§2), the
 * 48-item roster shape — 2 per category per rarity (§3), the effect-line count per rarity (§3),
 * the full 33-effect pool with each effect's shape (§3), the reuse ceiling of 3 per effect (§3),
 * additive same-category stacking with no cap and no set bonuses (§4), and the 2→5 slot
 * progression (§7).
 *
 * **Not specified:** Artifact *names* and the per-item rarity assignment of pool effects — §3
 * leaves both "to implementation", the same deferral Champions had. Names were authored in the
 * 2026-09-15 naming pass (`ARTIFACT_NAMES`); the effect assignment is still a shared distribution
 * table (`ARTIFACT_EFFECT_SLOTS`) rather than 48 authored choices.
 *
 * ## Every effect is rendered as a passive modifier, and several are approximations
 *
 * The pool describes machinery the engine does not have: buffs that ramp over a fight's duration,
 * procs on kill, a once-per-fight death save, cooldown refunds on crit. The averaged idle rate is
 * one frozen rate per window by construction (`tech-architecture.md` §4a) and has no notion of
 * "later in the fight" at all. Each such effect is rendered as the nearest honest modifier, with a
 * `note` saying what was dropped.

 * §3 fixes the budget: 12 Artifacts per category needing 20 effect-line fills (6 solo at
 * Common/Uncommon/Rare + 8 across the Epic/Legendary pairs + 6 across the Mythic triples), under
 * a **ceiling of 3 uses per effect**. Against pools of 9/8/9/7 that is comfortable — 20 fills
 * into 21–27 capacity — which is exactly what §3's correction says: the ceiling is the rule, not
 * a fixed count of 3 each.
 *
 *     common     {0}     / {1}
 *     uncommon   {2}     / {3}
 *     rare       {4}     / {5}

 *     mythic     {0,1,2} / {3,4,5}
 *
 * Shared by all four categories, so the three structural rules — line count per rarity, the ≤3
 * reuse cap, and no two same-rarity Artifacts sharing a kit — are properties of one table.
 *
 * **Index 6 debuts at Epic**, which is §3's own "flavor device": each category's newest effect
 * (Shattering Blow, Unbroken, Chain Reaction, Windfall — all four listed at index 6) never
 * appears at a solo rarity. §3 notes that the larger pools made this optional rather than
 * required, and keeps it deliberately.
 *
 * **Fortune has only 7 effects and its slots reach index 6**, so the whole pool is used; the
 * other three categories have 8–9 and leave their tail unreached — Defense Penetration and Cull,
 * Crit Resistance, Double Cast and Unshaken sit in the pool but on no Artifact. That is the
 * consequence of one shared table rather than four bespoke ones; the assignment pass can promote

 * Every equipped Artifact's effect lines, party-wide.

 * Unlike Gear there is no unequipped passive: §1 makes Artifacts an equipped loadout, and no doc
 * grants an un-slotted Artifact anything.
