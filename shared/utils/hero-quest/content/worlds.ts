/**
 * The 10 worlds a prestige run walks through.
 *
 * **Names and themes only.** Nothing here affects a single number: every stat comes from
 * `settle.enemyStatsAt`, which knows only the run index. Enemies have no kits of their own yet
 * (`open-items.md` #6), so a roster here is a name and an art brief, not a mechanic.
 *
 * **The arc is a walk toward the source.** The archmage of Duskspire (World 6) opened a door
 * to the Void, and the cracks it left spread outward through the kingdom. A run starts at the
 * farthest frontier, where the damage is only feral hedgerows, and walks inward — through places
 * the Void has hollowed a little more each time — past the door itself and out through the edge
 * of the world into **The Void** (World 10). Void Shards are named after it
 * (`economy-and-currencies.md` §3), which is also the lore of a prestige: reach the end, and
 * start again stronger.
 *
 * **Naming rules the UI depends on:**
 * - `enemyName` pluralises with a plain "s" (`RunPosition` renders "Bramble Goblins defeated").
 * - Boss names never start with "The", because sentences read "Fight Old Gnarlhide" and
 *   "Old Gnarlhide blocks the way".
 * - No name reuses a Champion given name or title, so a boss is never mistaken for a pull.
 *
 * The fixed pool never re-themes between prestiges (`core-progression-and-prestige.md` §5) —
 * difficulty is communicated entirely through the stat curve, which is what keeps art scope
 * flat no matter how many prestiges a player stacks up.
