/**
 * Training Grounds — the 36-skill roster (`skills-gacha.md`).
 *
 * **Hero-only.** Champions carry their own kits, fixed at recruitment, and this system never
 * touches them (§1). Equipped in 2–5 dedicated slots bought through the prestige shop (§6);
 * every equipped Active auto-fires the instant its cooldown ends, exactly like a class-tree
 * skill, because there is no manual-cast mode anywhere in this game.
 *
 * ## The roster is doc-authored, which makes this pass a transcription
 *
 * Unlike Champions — where seven class skills had nothing but a name in a tree diagram — §4
 * gives a complete 36-entry draft: name, type, and a one-line effect for every one. The doc's
 * own wording is quoted above each entry so a later reading can check the transcription rather
 * than re-derive intent. What is *not* in the doc is any magnitude ("small", "medium–large",
 * "a portion"), which is why every number here comes from `constants.ts`.
 *
 * ## Two types, two mechanisms
 *
 * - **Active** → an `AbilityEffect`, joining the Hero's kit in `fight.ts` and `projection.ts`.
 *   Plugs into the existing cooldown/SPD system with no new combat code (§3).
 * - **Passive** → `HqModifier` lines, folded into the stat pipeline and the economy rates. The
 *   Phase 3 brief asked whether these belong in `stats.ts` rather than as combat statuses, and
 *   they do: a Passive is "always on, no cooldown, no button" (§3), which is the definition of a
 *   stat modifier and not of a status with a duration.
 *
 * Exactly 18 of each, an exact 50/50 split, 3 Active and 3 Passive per rarity (§3).
 *
 * ## Universality is now nearly self-enforcing
 *
 * §3's core rule is that no skill may hard-reference a path-specific stat, since any Hero can
 * equip any skill. With STR/DEX/INT merged into PWR there *is* no path-specific stat left to
 * reference by accident — every line below targets one of the six stats every class has, or an
 * external resource (Gold, XP, offline efficiency) that has nothing to do with class at all.
 * `content.spec.ts` asserts it anyway, because the rule outlives the merge that made it easy.
