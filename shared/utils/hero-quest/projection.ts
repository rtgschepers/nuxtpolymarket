/**
 * Ability effects, averaged into the idle rate.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Abilities only ever fired in `fight.ts`, which resolves boss stages. `settle.ts` had no
 * skill term at all — so a Support's heal and a Control's armour shred did nothing during the
 * ~97% of playtime that is idle wave farming, and two archetypes stayed decorative outside a
 * gate. This is the bridge.
 *
 * ## The hard constraint: settle is rate math, not a tick loop
 *
 * `settle()` computes **one frozen rate** and holds it for a whole window — that is the entire
 * lazy-settle contract (`tech-architecture.md` §4a), and it is what lets a 72-hour offline
 * window resolve in constant time instead of simulating 259,200 seconds. So nothing here may
 * iterate time. Every effect collapses to a scalar:
 *
 *     uptime(effect) = min(1, duration / cooldown)
 *
 * An ability with a 6s buff on an 8s cooldown is up 75% of the time, so its +25% PWR is worth
 * +18.75% averaged. A target pattern that reaches 3 of 6 enemies counts for half. Nothing else.
 *
 * ## This is an approximation, and it is allowed to be wrong
 *
 * `fight.ts` rolls crits, resolves statuses on a grid, and lets a stun land on a body that was
 * about to swing. None of that survives averaging. What is guaranteed is that the projection
 * stays within a stated tolerance of a real fight over the same party and stage — asserted in
 * `test/hero-quest/projection.spec.ts`, which is the contract. If the tolerance cannot be met,
 * the approximation is wrong, not the test.
