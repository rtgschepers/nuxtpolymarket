/**
 * Where every number on a unit comes from.
 *
 * `stats.ts` computes the party's stats; this re-walks the same pipeline and *records* each
 * step instead of collapsing it. Both surfaces that show a breakdown — the `--report=stats` sim
 * report and the in-game stat panel — render this one structure, so the two can never describe
 * the pipeline differently.
 *
 * ## The one thing that makes this worth having
 *
 * Every source is reported in **stages of enemy curve** as well as in its own units. That is the
 * only common denominator the game has: enemies grow `ENEMY_STEP_BASE^n` over one index `n`, and
 * a stat multiplier is worth however many steps of that it cancels. It converts the question
 * "is ×1.36 from my collection a lot?" — unanswerable — into "my collection is worth 4 stages",
 * which is directly comparable to the 100 stages a prestige loop costs.
 *
 * See `stagesOfCurve`. The conversion runs through `DPS_STAT_EXPONENT`, because damage rides the
 * stat curve more than once and a source that lifts every stat by 36% is worth more than 36%.
 *
 * ## Additive within a stage, multiplicative between stages
 *
 * ⚠ **This is the trap, and it is why per-source factors are not reported as multipliers.**
 * `sumModifiers` sums Gear, Skill and Artifact lines as *fractions* and converts once, and
 * `mergeTotals` composes two already-summed sets as `a + b - 1`. Gear +50% and a Skill +50% are
 * therefore ×2.00 together, not ×2.25. Reporting each source as its own multiplier and inviting
 * the reader to multiply them would overstate every stacked build. So a stage carries one factor
 * and itemises its sources as the additive percentages they actually are.
 *
 * Pure, like everything in `shared/`. It reads a `HeroSnapshot` and returns a description.
