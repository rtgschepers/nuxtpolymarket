/**
 * Seeded boss resolution (`tech-architecture.md` §4c).
 *
 * A boss cannot be lazily settled — offline never engages one — and cannot be resolved by
 * the client, because Gold and Void Shards are real balances. So the server runs this, and
 * hands the client the seed. The client then runs the *identical* function and animates the
 * exact authoritative fight, blow for blow. Divergence is impossible because it is the same
 * pure code on both sides; the client renders, it never decides.
 *
 * ## Rolled here, averaged in `settle`
 *
 * Wave farming is a *rate*, so `settle.ts` averages crit. A boss is a *fight*, so this rolls
 * it — real variance, still fully deterministic and replayable. That is a deliberate
 * asymmetry (`tech-architecture.md` §4c recommends it; `open-items.md` #3 records that it is
 * a recommendation rather than a lock).
 *
 * ## The randomness rule, and why a PRNG here is not a violation
 *
 * The platform forbids `Math.random()` for anything deciding an outcome, and forbids rolling
 * your own generator from `crypto.getRandomValues`. Neither applies: the entropy that
 * decides this fight is the **seed**, which the server draws with `randomInt` from
 * `#shared/utils/random` before calling in. Everything past that point must be reproducible
 * from the seed alone or the replay would not match, which is exactly what a CSPRNG cannot
 * give you. Same shape as `shared/utils/gamelogic/pathwarden-simulator.ts`.
 *
 * ## Skills
 *
 * Every skill auto-fires the instant its cooldown completes — there is no manual mode anywhere
 * in this game (`classes-and-combat.md` §3). **Every unit fires its own kit**: the Hero's is
 * cumulative down the class path plus equipped Skill Actives (`heroKit`), while a Champion
 * brings the 1–3 its rarity grants (`champions-guild-gacha.md` §2). Each ability's behaviour —
 * targeting, statuses, heals, shields — comes from its `AbilityEffect` (`effects.ts`).
 *
 * The wave rate sees these only as averages (`projection.ts`), so a boss fight and the idle rate
 * agree within the tolerance `projection.spec.ts` asserts, not exactly.
 *
 * Ability *count* is a real rarity payoff: a Mythic's three abilities out-damage a Common's one
 * on top of the ×2.5 stat multiplier — the intended shape, never balanced against it.
