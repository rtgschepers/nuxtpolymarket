/**
 * Seeded boss resolution (`tech-architecture.md` §4c).
 *
 * A boss cannot be lazily settled — offline never engages one — and cannot be resolved by
 * the client, because Gold and Void Shards are real balances. So the server runs this, and
 * hands the client the seed. The client then runs the *identical* function and animates the
 * exact authoritative fight, blow for blow. Divergence is impossible because it is the same
 * pure code on both sides; the client renders, it never decides.
 *
 * ## Rolled here, averaged in `settle`
 *
 * Wave farming is a *rate*, so `settle.ts` averages crit. A boss is a *fight*, so this rolls
 * it — real variance, still fully deterministic and replayable. That is a deliberate
 * asymmetry (`tech-architecture.md` §4c recommends it; `open-items.md` #3 records that it is
 * a recommendation rather than a lock).
 *
 * ## The randomness rule, and why a PRNG here is not a violation
 *
 * The platform forbids `Math.random()` for anything deciding an outcome, and forbids rolling
 * your own generator from `crypto.getRandomValues`. Neither applies: the entropy that
 * decides this fight is the **seed**, which the server draws with `randomInt` from
 * `#shared/utils/random` before calling in. Everything past that point must be reproducible
 * from the seed alone or the replay would not match, which is exactly what a CSPRNG cannot
 * give you. Same shape as `shared/utils/gamelogic/pathwarden-simulator.ts`.
 *
 * ## Skills
 *
 * Every skill auto-fires the instant its cooldown completes — there is no manual mode
 * anywhere in this game (`classes-and-combat.md` §3). **Every unit fires its own kit**: the
 * Hero's is cumulative down the class path, so a Berserker brings four skills and a Beginner
 * one, while a Champion brings the 1–3 its rarity grants (`champions-guild-gacha.md` §2).
 *
 * All of them — 16 class skills and 28 Champion abilities — currently resolve as
 * single-target damage on a shared placeholder cooldown and multiplier. The distinctive
 * behaviours the docs sketch (chaining, multi-target, summons, heals, the whole Support and
 * Control archetype identities) have no numeric model anywhere and are not built. What is
 * built is the framework that fires them; the effects are a later content pass.
 *
 * **Two consequences worth knowing:**
 *
 * 1. `settle.ts` has no skill term at all, so a boss's DPS check is fought with strictly
 *    more damage than the wave rate on screen implies. That gap is intentional but untuned,
 *    it moves whenever `SKILL_BASE_ABILITY_MULTIPLIER` moves, and it **widened when Champion
 *    abilities started firing** — a party of six now brings up to 19 skills to a boss and
 *    still none to the wave rate.
 * 2. Ability *count* is now a real rarity payoff, not just flavour. A Mythic's three
 *    abilities out-damage a Common's one on top of the ×2.5 stat multiplier, which is the
 *    intended shape but has never been balanced against it.
