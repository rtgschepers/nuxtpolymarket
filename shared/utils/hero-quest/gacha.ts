 * ## `foldToAvailableRarity` — deleted, and the reason is recorded rather than lost

 * A helper used to live here that folded a rolled rarity *down* to the nearest rarity a partial
 * roster actually populated, because the §3 drop table weights all six and assumes all six
 * exist. Phase 2's Champions covered Common / Rare / Mythic only, so better than half of all
 * rolls at gacha level 7+ named a rarity with nothing in it.
 *
 * **All four rosters now populate all six rarities** — Champions 48, Gear 36, Skills 36,
 * Artifacts 48 — which made the fold the identity function everywhere, the exact condition its
 * own docstring named for removal (`implementation-plan.md`, Phase 3: "deleted outright the day
 * every roster is complete"). `content.spec.ts` asserts the population per system, so the claim
 * "no fold is needed" is tested rather than commented.
 *
 * Worth keeping the *reasoning* even though the code is gone, because it is the answer to a
 * question a future partial roster will ask again: rounding **down** was the conservative
 * repair. Picking uniformly from whatever exists inverts the curve — with 4 of 12 Champions
 * Mythic, every unshipped roll became 33% Mythic and pushed the effective level-10 Mythic rate
 * from a designed 3.0% to 28.7%. Folding downward can never pay better than the roll earned.
 *
 * `effectiveDropRates` went with it: the effective table and the designed table are now the
 * same table, so serving one through a fold would only hide that fact.
