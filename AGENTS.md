# Polynux

A play-money gaming site. Players earn and spend **coins** (`user.balance`) and **gems** (`user.gems`) across casino games (slots, dice, roulette, live tables), idle and strategy games (Xeno, Hack Ops, Colony, Polytown, Pathwarden, …), a TCG, a bank, a gem exchange and an AI assistant. Every feature touches the economy, so treat value-changing code with care.

## Stack

- Nuxt 4 + Vue 3, **Nuxt UI v4** (use its components and semantic tokens)
- Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL (`server/database/schema.ts`)
- better-auth
- **bun only**. Never `npm`, `pnpm` or `yarn`. `bun.lock` is the only lockfile.

## Layout

- `app/`: pages, components, composables and utils (all auto-imported)
- `server/api/`: Nitro file routes (`*.get.ts`, `*.post.ts`); shared logic lives in `server/utils/`
- `shared/`: code used by both client and server (game rules, payouts, random)
- `content/changelog/`: the player-facing changelog
- `scripts/`: economy balance simulations (`bun run balance:*`)

## Client

- `useAuth()` gives `{ user, fetchSession, signOut }`. `user.value.balance` is a numeric string, so use `parseFloat` for comparisons. Call `fetchSession()` after anything that changes balance or gems.
- `formatNumber(value, compact = true)` for every coin and gem amount shown.
- Coin and gem inputs accept `10k`/`2.5m` shorthand: bind `useAmountInput(ref)` to the input and show `amountPreview(text)` as a trailing hint.
- `apiFetch` for typed API calls; `apiErrorMessage(e, fallback)` for error text.
- Colors: semantic tokens (`text-primary`, `text-muted`, `bg-elevated`, `border-default`), not raw hex or Tailwind palette colors.
- **Toasts are for errors and failures only** (`'error'` / `'warning'`). Never add success or confirmation toasts; the UI updating is the feedback.

## Server

Protected endpoints start with:
```ts
const session = await auth.api.getSession({ headers: event.headers })
if (!session?.user?.id) throw createError({ statusCode: 401, statusMessage: 'Unauthorized' })
```

Import with `#server/…` and `#shared/…` aliases.

**Balance**: `server/utils/balance.ts` has `credit`, `debit`, `creditGems`, `debitGems`, `getBalance` and `getHistory`. Amounts are numeric strings (`'25.50'`), with an optional category (`'game:dice'`). `debit`/`debitGems` throw 400 when the user can't afford it, so don't pre-check. Each write logs a `transactions` row. **Inside a `db.transaction()` that holds a lock, pass `tx` as the last argument**, otherwise the write uses a second connection and deadlocks.

### Concurrency: never read-then-write value

Assume every endpoint that grants or spends value gets hit by a burst of parallel requests (10 parallel rakeback claims once paid out 10x). A `SELECT` check followed by an `UPDATE` is always a bug. The mutation must be the guard:

- **Claim-then-reward**: flip a flag with a conditional update and only pay if a row came back.
  ```ts
  const [claimed] = await tx.update(hackOps).set({ collected: true })
      .where(and(eq(hackOps.id, opId), eq(hackOps.userId, userId), eq(hackOps.collected, false)))
      .returning()
  if (!claimed) throw createError({ statusCode: 400, statusMessage: 'Already collected' })
  ```
  Sells work the same way: `DELETE … RETURNING`, then credit.
- **Lock-then-read**: `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` inside a transaction (see `getLockedBankState` in `server/utils/bank.ts`), read inside the lock, and pass `tx` to every write.

**Never compare-and-swap on a timestamp column.** Postgres stores microseconds but JS `Date` holds milliseconds, so the `WHERE` matches zero rows. Use lock-then-read instead. Integer and boolean CAS is fine.

Self-check: if the same request runs twice at once, the second one must throw.

### Randomness

Never use `Math.random()` for outcomes, payouts, drops or rolls. Use `#shared/utils/random` instead: `randomFloat()` [0,1), `randomInt(min, max)` inclusive, `randomPick(arr)`, `randomChance(p)`. `Math.random()` is only acceptable for cosmetic effects. Don't roll your own from `crypto.getRandomValues`.

## Schema changes

Edit `schema.ts`, then run `bun run db:generate` (commit the generated `drizzle/NNNN_*.sql`) and `bun run db:migrate`. Deploys run `drizzle-kit migrate`. **Never put `db:push` in the deploy path**: it prompts on destructive diffs, a container can't answer, and it exits 0 having applied nothing (production outage, 2026-08-04). `push` is fine for throwaway local work.

## Code style

- `server/` and `shared/`: 4-space indent. Elsewhere, match the file.
- No semicolons, single quotes, no trailing commas, 1tbs braces.

## Workflow

- **Changelog**: every day of work gets a short, player-facing entry in `content/changelog/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` for today's date (create or extend it).
- **Before any commit**: `bun run typecheck` and `bun run test` must both pass. `nuxt build` does not typecheck. A red `main` blocks every branch and deploy, so fix failures and call out any that are genuinely pre-existing. DB tests need the compose Postgres running.
- **Commits**: only when asked. Short imperative subject, no body or footer, no `Co-Authored-By`. Split commits by concern.
- **Branches**: `feature/…` or `bugfix/…` in kebab-case, from an up-to-date `main`.
- **PRs**: title is the branch name, empty body, base `main`.
- **Rebases**: you may `git fetch` and start a `git rebase`, then stop. Don't resolve conflicts, continue or push.
