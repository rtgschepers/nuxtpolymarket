# Hero Quest — Art Style & Generation Guide

How Hero Quest's art is made and what it must look like. `asset-list.md` and `asset-checklist.md` say **what** to draw; this doc says **how**. Written 2026-09-24 at the end of restyle rounds 2 and 3 (commit `4614af8a` on `hero-quest-art`), so work can pick up on another machine.

---

## 1. Ground rules

- **All art is procedural code.** Drawers in `app/utils/hero-quest-art/`, registered in `catalog.ts`. No PixelLab, no image generation, no hand-painted PNGs. The PixelLab class portraits in `public/hero-quest/classes/` are inspiration only.
- **One hero.** Every class is the same Beginner rookie, re-outfitted: messy brown hair, young face, a plaster on his cheek. Headgear, outfit, weapon and pose change per class; the face never does. Tier shows in the gear: base classes are novices in hand-me-downs, elites are specialised, masters are unmistakable.
- **The Hero and Champion designs are locked** (2026-09-25). All 16 classes and all 48 Champions (their looks, kits, weapons, shields and the four chassis clips) are approved as they stand. Don't redesign a class or a Champion, or change its silhouette, colours or weapon, without asking; a fix that keeps the design (a stray pixel, a clip running off the frame) is fine, but say what changed.
- **World 1, Thornwick Vale, is locked** (2026-09-26): its background, the Bramble Goblin (classic body, in the jerkin-and-vine outfit of the third pass), Old Gnarlhide ridden by the goblins' warboss, and Gorsecrown as the Wicker King. The same terms as the Heroes and Champions: ask before changing a design. The restyle now goes world by world, World 2 next.
- **The backgrounds of Worlds 2–10 are locked** (2026-09-26): Mirewood, Cinderpass (with Round 2's two volcanoes), Rimeholt (with Round 3's mountains and trees), Sunken Amarath, Duskspire, The Bonefields (with Round 4's giants), The Shattered Sky (with Round 5's islands, clouds and island edge), The Brink (Round 6, the redesigned World 9) and The Void (with Round 7's upgrade), as built in the fourth pass's Rounds 1–7 plus the foreground layer. Only the backgrounds: those worlds' enemies and bosses are still round-1 art and open. Same terms: ask before changing a design. Every world background is now locked.
- **World 1 gained a foreground layer after it was locked** (2026-09-26, at the user's request): its framing pines moved into `front()`, rooted on the bank in front of the near rank and lengthened by the same 12 rows so their tops stay put, with hedge and fern clumps at their feet. The rest of World 1 is unchanged.
- **Indexed pixels only.** A `Surface` stores palette indices, never colours. There is no alpha: fades are Bayer dither (`dither`, `ditherDisc`, `StampStyle.dissolve`) and dims or tints are palette remaps (`shadeLut`).
- **10 fps stepped animation** (`ANIM_FPS`). Clips are keyframes over the `HP` pose parameters, sampled on the frame grid.
- **Deterministic.** Layout and particle spread come from `hash2`, never `Math.random`, so an exported strip is identical from run to run. `Math.random` is allowed only in the live stage (`demo.ts`) for cosmetics.
- **The exported PNGs are a rendering, not a source.** `public/hero-quest/sprites/` is produced by `bun run art:hero-quest`. It is currently **stale on purpose**: the palette grew, so regenerating rewrites all ~1,000 tracked files. Regenerate once the restyle rounds are approved.

---

## 2. The reference: what "video style" means

The target look comes from a short reference video: `x-downloader.com_tbSWXD.mp4`, 39 s, 1920×1080 at 60 fps. It is not in the repo, so copy it over separately if you need it. It shows five chibi heroes (ninja, frost wizard, fire witch, priest, knight), each casting a named ultimate at a scarecrow on a night lakeshore. What we take from it:

- **Characters:** chunky, big-headed chibis about 24 px tall, drawn at roughly 7.5× scale. A 1 px near-black outline, 2–3 flat shades per material, one strong accent colour each.
- **Every skill runs the same choreography:**
  1. A gold banner with the skill's name appears at the top.
  2. The scene dims toward the skill's colour.
  3. A glowing rune ring lights up under the caster.
  4. One big effect travels or falls: a meteor from a sky portal, a dragon, a light pillar.
  5. Each impact is a solid blob of energy with a white core, inside a thin white shock ring, with sparks thrown out.
  6. The target flashes to a white silhouette.
  7. Small damage numbers stack in a column, with a big total above them.
  8. Something lingers afterwards: the target keeps burning, embers drift.
- **Scenery:** layered and atmospheric, with big dark pines framing both edges of the screen, a thin grass ledge, and water below it mirroring everything, fighters included.

## 3. Workflow: review rounds

The restyle goes in **small rounds**. Convert a sub-selection, let the user review it, then continue. **Commit before each round** so the round can be rolled back.

1. Build the round.
2. Add it to `ART_ROUNDS` in `catalog.ts` (number, label, the ID prefixes it touched). The gallery shows each asset under the round that last changed it.
3. Review at `/hero-quest/art` (dev builds only). It opens on the newest round's chip; older rounds keep their own chips. The **Live stage** at the top plays a real fight: pick a world and a class. Every other wave is a boss wave, the world's boss and super boss in turn (waves 2 and 4, 6 and 8, ...), so both come round within about half a minute. It opens on World 1 with the Sorcerer.
4. Review headlessly as you build, since Claude can't see a signed-in browser:
   - `bun run art:hero-quest sheet <out.png> <group> [id-prefix…] --scale 3` renders a contact sheet, one row per asset. Read the PNG.
   - For the live stage, drive `BattleDemo` from a small bun script: `setup(world, classId)`, `update(1/60)` in a loop, then `render()` into `encodeIndexedPng` from `scripts/lib/png.ts`. Overriding `Math.random` to return under 0.3 forces the hero to cast.
5. Before committing: `bun run typecheck`, `bun run test`, and eslint on the touched files.

### Done so far

**The round count has restarted three times** (2026-09-25/26): once the chibi style was adopted, again once the Hero designs were locked, and again once World 1 was locked. The current pass is the fourth; Rounds 1 (the Worlds 2–10 backgrounds), 2 (the foreground layer and Cinderpass's volcanoes) 3 (Rimeholt's trees and mountains), 4 (the Bonefields giants) 5 (the Shattered Sky's islands and clouds), 6 (World 9 redesigned as The Brink) and 7 (the Void upgrade) are in `ART_ROUNDS`, so **the next round is Round 8**. The tables below are the history; none of those round numbers are in the gallery any more.

#### First pass

| Round | Scope |
|---|---|
| 2 · video style | **Heroes** Beginner, Warrior, Sorcerer, Hunter on the chibi body (5 states each) · their **skills** Haste, Whirlwind, Meteor Shower, Kill Shot as cinematics · **skill banners** · **damage numbers** (hit/crit) · **training dummy** as the video's scarecrow · **World 1 Thornwick Vale** background · live-stage presentation (tint, banner, stacked numbers, water reflection) |
| 3 · scenery tier | Palette split into a character tier and a scenery tier · World 1 moved onto it · specs enforcing the split · palette swatch sheets in the gallery |
| 4 · formation & march | Both sides on the 3 front / 3 back grid, shown as three ranks of two · World 1's field deepened to hold them · a sixth `move` state on every Hero and chassis (`walkClip` / `floatClip` in `rig.ts`, generated from each unit's own rest pose) · the party marches between waves while the scenery parallax-scrolls and the next wave closes in |
| 5 · chibi classes | **The chibi style was adopted** (2026-09-25, after outside opinions: it beat the taller full-body restyle tried on the Sorcerer, which is gone). The other 11 classes rebuilt on the chibi body, and the Sorcerer back on the chibi body, then made more imposing than the Wizard (as the master, he must outclass the elite): he hovers over flame, with the biggest hat in the roster, a dark cape and high collar, and a fire orb circling him. The robe hem now rides `jump`, so floating casters leave the ground. The rest: Barbarian, Berserker, Knight, Paladin, Mage, Wizard, Shaman, Witch Doctor, Archer, Bowman, Marksman, Beast Master. The classic Hero definitions are deleted; the classes now live one file per line |

#### Second pass, after the first restart

| Round | Scope |
|---|---|
| 1 · live stage feel | Pixel Crusade's presentation ported to the live stage, scaled for a crowd (§5a): local hit holds, gated scene freezes, shake, flash and slow motion, kill rings, bodies shattering into their own pixels, rim light, afterimages, projectiles, and effects and scenery on a smooth 60 Hz clock. World 1's clouds drift and birds and pollen cross it on the stage only. No asset changed, so it has no gallery chip: review it on the Live stage |
| 2 · close-up camera | Pixel Crusade's item 5, camera half: `CAMERAS` in `demo.ts` crops a 16:9 window of the composed 320×180 scene, and the integer-scale fit shows a smaller window with bigger pixels. **Zoom 1** 320×180, the original (6× on a 1080p screen); **Zoom 2** 224×126 (8×); **Zoom 3** 272×153, between them (7×, **chosen and the default**: closer than the original, with room for a large boss); **Tight** 192×108 (10×, about Pixel Crusade's proportions). The HUD is drawn on the window. No art changed. Switch cameras on the Live stage with the select or live with keys 1–4, fullscreen included |
| 3 · chibi summons | The three summons rebuilt in the chibi style, so they sit with chibi Heroes and, later, chibi Champions: the **Disciple** a hovering hooded acolyte with a bobbing halo, a sun-mace and a lantern; the **Raised Dead** a big-skulled skeleton with grave-green eyes, a ribcage, rags and a rusted sword; the **Wolf** a chibi creature with a head as big as its body, stubby legs and a bushy plume of a tail. They stay a little smaller than the Hero. Also shown in the Disciple, Raise Dead and Man's Best Friend skill effects. `robe()` moved into `hero-kit.ts` |
| 4 · damage numbers | One typeface for every number (the 3×5, and its hand-drawn 1.5× mid cut for crits and totals) instead of two unrelated fonts, a banner-style gradient fill, and a white landing flash with a crit hop. See §5 |
| 5 · chibi Champions | All 48 Champions and the four chassis on the chibi body, so they stand at the Heroes' scale. Each is still a row in `SKINS`; `championHead()` assembles a head on the Hero grid (12 wide, neck at column 5, eye at 9, face in the bottom six rows) by stamping pixel maps for the row's hair style, beard, elf ears and headgear, so each Champion has their own face, not the rookie's. Torsos are 10×8, robes use `robe()`, capes `chibiCape()`, the melee smear is a `crescent()`, and the rarity ladder is kept (trim; pauldron and cape; collar and chest gem; gold, back pauldron, wings and halo; mythic aura and spark). Rest poses raise the hands two rows for the shorter torso, and the tank's cast raise moved off the face. `chibiHead` gained `lid` and `mouth` options for visors and masks |
| 6 · antler staves and bows | The totem staff head (`Gem.Totem`) with its carved face is now a pair of antlers lashed to the wood with a bead charm (`antlers()` in `weapons.ts`): the Shaman, Ordo, Vaelora and the Bramble Goblin's staff, plus the Totem Storm icon and effect, whose planted post wears the same antlers. The Hunter and Beast Master carry crossbows (`crossbow()`, `crossbowPainter`; steel prod for the Hunter, bone for the Beast Master) and the stage flies their shots as flat, fast quarrels. The bow line steps up in length: Archer short bow (7), Bowman middle bow (11), Marksman longbow (15), which he carries slanted and draws aiming a little upward from his knee so the lower limb stays inside the frame. The Berserker's hand axes had their blades on the upper side of the haft (`axe()` always put it there), so they pointed up and trailed every chop; `axe(…, under)` moves the blade to the leading side, and he now holds both axes forward at the ready instead of low by his boots. Every other single-bladed axe (Sorrek, Bastyn, each world's axe enemy) takes `under` too, so no swing trails its edge; double axes and the static icons are unchanged. The Knight now carries his shield in front: a smaller `ShieldStyle.Heater` (a kite cut to chibi size, so it no longer dips below the feet) painted in `over` after his pauldron, since a shield drawn as the `offhand` sits behind the body and always read as tucked under the shoulder. His pauldron, which started on the chin row, is a rounded plate on the shoulder (the chin sits on torso row 1). The Paladin read as Norse (winged helm, round gold shield, a hammer) and was redesigned as a holy knight: a steel helm with a gold brow cross and rim, the face open (a halo over it and a closed great helm were both tried and dropped), white-and-gold plate, a crimson cape, a white heater shield with a gold cross carried in front like the Knight's, and a `flangedMace` held raised at the ready |

#### Third pass, after the Hero designs were locked (closed when World 1 was locked)

| Round | Scope |
|---|---|
| 1 · Champion shields in front | The 12 tank Champions carried their shield as the `offhand`, drawn behind the body, so it always read as tucked under the pauldron. They now carry it in front like the Knight and Paladin: painted in `over` after the pauldron, from a shield hand moved forward (`TANK_REST` `bhx 3`). The full-size shields are taller than the space between a Champion's chin and feet, so each is carried as its chibi cut (`frontShield()`): Round as the new `Targe`, Kite as `Heater`, Tower as the new `Pavise` |
| 2 · Bramble Goblin outfit | A chibi goblin was built and reverted (2026-09-25): a big-headed version and two smaller-headed cuts all read oddly, so World 1's enemies stay on the classic body with their classic head. What survived is the outfit: a leather jerkin with a lit patch, bound in two strands of thorny vine with three berries, a ragged hem, brown trousers and bare green feet |
| 3 · World 1 bosses | Two redesigns for Thornwick Vale's bosses, built as prototypes beside the old pair, compared on the Live stage, then **adopted** in `bosses-a.ts` under the content names (`OLD_GNARLHIDE`, `GORSECROWN`); the old hedge-boar and walking hedgerow are gone. Not chibi: bosses stay imposing, at the old buffer sizes. **Goblin warboss** (Stage 5, 96px): Old Gnarlhide saddled and harnessed, a studded girth and red blanket, an iron snout ring, and the goblins' chieftain riding him in a scrap-iron helm under a bramble crown, a bone mantle and war paint, swinging a broad cleaver, a tattered war banner with a skull finial on a pole behind. **The Wicker King** (Stage 10, 128px): a hollow giant woven from hedge-wood on human lines: long jointed legs, a broad woven trunk running from a yoke of shoulders straight to the hips with no waist, gorse-fire burning in the hollow of his ribs, and two jointed arms, one hanging open-handed, the other swinging a burning fist. His head is a goat skull carved from pale wood with a short blunt snout, fire in the eye socket, a jaw that drops open on the roar, and ram's horns curling round beside it (`ramHorn()`) with gorse at their roots. Tan and gold so he stands out of the green field, as tall as Gorsecrown. Earlier cuts were dropped: a round body with a woven head read as silly; then a long snout read as a dog, a pinched waist and a curved boneless arm read oddly, and a thorn lash in the back hand looked like a weapon he never used. |

#### Fourth pass, after World 1 was locked

| Round | Scope |
|---|---|
| 1 · backgrounds | Worlds 2–10 rebuilt on Thornwick Vale's layout (§6): a field from y 110 deep enough for the three ranks (the old scenes floored at 148, so the rear two ranks stood in the sky and the props), the backdrop rooted along its far edge, parallax at four or more depths plus a depth-scaled field, framing at both edges on `SCROLL_PERIOD`, and a foreground past the lip. All nine are on the scenery tier and pass the fight-band rule, so the blend problem listed under Open is gone. **Mirewood** a violet moonrise over cypress stands in mist, a peat bog with black pools, moss-hung trunks framing, black water in front; **Cinderpass** mid-eruption, an ash plume lit from below and lava bombs, lava falls, kobold skull banners and braziers, a grey basalt pass with glowing cracks, basalt columns framing, a lava river in front; **Rimeholt** night under a swaying aurora, moonlit peaks, firelit longhouses with smoke, a snowfield in blue shadow, snow-laden pines and a rune stone framing, a black fjord in front; **Sunken Amarath** the surface far above, light shafts, the drowned city and the sea-queen's colossus in the murk, kelp and coral, a sand-choked plaza with moving caustics, broken columns framing, steps into the trench; **Duskspire** a plum-to-gold twilight with the Void door torn open and light spiralling into it, mage towers with turning rune rings, a lamplit balustrade, a paved plaza with an inlaid rune circle, obelisks with floating crystals framing, a reflecting pool; **The Bonefields** a blood sunset behind a ruined fortress, a host of spears and banners on the ridge, churned earth with red-lit mud pools, a colossus's ribs and a planted greatsword framing, a trench of bones and skulls in front; **The Shattered Sky** a breaking storm with a shaft of sun and lightning on the loop, islands adrift at three depths with waterfalls, the party on a grassy island whose broken underside hangs over the clouds, wind-bent pines framing; **The Fraying** a bleached sepia sky with a hollow sun and tears hung with threads, outline-only hills, half-unmade cottages, a faded meadow coming undone, trees holding the last green, the world's edge fraying into nothing; **The Void** a black hole whose disk turns on the loop, fragments of the nine earlier worlds drifting, a plain of pale glass holding the disk's glow (the one light thing, since the Thralls are black), crystal shards framing, a black mirror in front. Every scene's loop closes; each draws in under 1.2 ms |
| 2 · foreground & volcanoes | Framing moved into a `front()` layer the stage draws over the fighters, and the march scroll snapped to the period (§6). **World 1** gets the layer too, by request after its lock: the framing pines rooted on the bank in front of the near rank, 12 rows taller so their tops stay put, with hedge and fern clumps at their feet. **Cinderpass** gets two volcanoes instead of one: the far one (`activeVolcano`) awake at the crater with a glow, smoke and spat bombs; the near one (`streamVolcano`) quiet at the top with one broad lava stream breaching its rim and winding down its flank, widening, hot pulses running down it on the loop. The regular black peaks moved behind both so they no longer cover the flanks |
| 3 · Rimeholt mountains | The framing pines' trunks never reached their canopies: the tiers step 8 rows but were counted as `h / 9`, so a tall pine's lowest tier ended 12 rows above its root and the 6-row trunk stub left a gap. `snowPine` now runs the trunk from under the lowest tier to the ground (4 px wide on tall trees) with snow at its foot. (`bigPine` in the kit has the same arithmetic; World 1's hedge clumps cover its trunks, so it was left alone.) The pyramid `peaks()` gave way to `massif()`: each mountain is a sharp horn, a twin summit, a lopsided shoulder or a broad rounded massif with a ragged crest, lit on the moon side, shaded past a ridge line falling from the summit, snow down to a ragged line (rock couloirs through the snow were tried and read as random grey strips, so they are gone). The trunks still slipped mid-march: the scroll is fractional then, and a tree's trunk rect, tier triangles and highlights each rounded to the grid on their own. `framing()` now snaps the whole foreground to whole pixels (every world, World 1 included), and the trunk is centred under the apex (odd widths, 3 or 5 px). It is also drawn **before** the tiers: drawn after, its top three rows painted over the lowest tier's foliage |
| 4 · Bonefields giants | The Bonefields retold as a battlefield of giants. The blood sunset is kept exactly (the user confirmed the time of day is right). The ruined fortress is gone; `giants()` (its own layer at 0.12, repeating on `GIANTS = 640`; a big background piece must repeat on at least the screen plus its own width, or it wraps with part of itself in view and pops in mid-march, which the fallen giant did at 440) lays a giant's skeleton on its back along the far ridge: its skull against the sun, lying on the back of its head with the face to the sky (`skullUp`, a side-on skull turned a quarter, jaw fallen open toward the body), a ribcage arching up off the spine under a breastbone, the pelvis and both knees raised, and a colossal notched greatsword driven slantwise through the ribcage into the ground (the ribs and breastbone are drawn over the blade so it reads as passing through the cage; the guard sits at the top of the Zoom 3 frame, the grip runs off it). The giant lies head-left and face-up, so its right side faces us: its far, left arm rises behind the cage and is drawn before the sword, so the blade hides the wrist and hand; only the tips show, the thumb over one edge of the blade and four fingers round the other; the near, right arm lies flung out along the ground. (A first cut had the giant slumped at the foot of a sword planted in the ridge; the user asked for it on its back with the sword through its chest.) A giant spear driven in slantwise and a second giant's horned, helmed skull sit further along. The mortal host's spears on the near ridge are smaller now, for scale. Giant rib tips and shield-sized vertebrae break through the field. The foreground ribs were cut off by the edge, so they never read as ribs; they are now a ribcage half-buried at the left edge (`boneArc`, both ends of every rib in the ground), and the planted sword at the right edge gave way to a giant's skeletal hand clawing up out of the earth (`boneHand`). Bones are `rock3` with a `sand3` rim on the sun side |
| 5 · Shattered Sky islands & clouds | The floating islands were a grass strip on one triangle of rock. `island()` now builds each from columns: a grass cap spilling over its edges, a band of earth, then bedded rock hanging down in jagged three-column spikes, lit on the sun's side (upper right) and shaded on the other, with roots dangling and swaying on the loop and loose rocks drifting beneath. Each depth has its own palette (`ISLE_FAR` hazed slate and lagoon, `ISLE_MID`, `ISLE_NEAR`), and a pine, a round tree or a ruin stands on top. The clouds were rows of identical discs; `cumulus()` piles lobes into a dome over a flat, shaded base, lights each lobe toward the sun and rims it, the rim warming to gold near the sun and the whole cloud flaring on a lightning frame. The sun's rays were dotted lines across the fight; they are wide, faint beams now, fading with distance. The party's own island edge (below `LIP`) was flat brown; it is built like the islands now: a grass lip dripping over, a band of earth with stones set in it, then bedded rock whose beds undulate along the cliff (straight beds read as stacked planks), broken seams with the ledge under each catching the light, the odd crack, and hanging spikes at the bottom, with roots swaying and loose rocks drifting below |
| 6 · The Brink | **World 9 redesigned and renamed** (2026-09-26, the user's call): The Fraying's sepia unravelling did not sit between the Shattered Sky's breaking world and the Void, so it became **The Brink**, the last ground at the edge of the world. Name, theme and id changed together (`world_the_fraying` → `world_the_brink`; saves were test saves, so no migration); the enemy names (Unravelled Knight, Sister Vesper, Liminus, the Last Door) were kept, their art is still round-1. The Mythic tempo Artifact named after the old world, Fraying Thread, became **Lodestone of the Brink** (`artifact_tempo_10`), its icon a dark stone drawing violet motes in. The scene: the storm burned out to a few torn rags, the sky gone to stars, and the Void itself small on the far horizon (`distantHole`, its disk turning on the loop) with its light building along the horizon; debris streams curving into it, dust and stones (`debrisStream`: evenly spaced motes that each advance one slot per loop, so it flows and still closes); slabs of land adrift and lifting off the broken far edge; no landmark on the edge (an old gate was tried and dropped because Liminus, the Last Door, is already a door; a lighthouse replacing it looked out of place; the debris streams, drifting slabs and the far Void carry the depth); the field dark violet stone lit from the horizon in long streaks, fissures glowing, pebbles lifting off it over their shadows as gravity fails; a slab of ground peeling up at the left edge and a broken pillar ringed with hovering stones at the right; the near edge crumbling into the stars with chunks falling away |
| 7 · Void upgrade | By request after the lock. The black hole is 1.35× larger (`HOLE_SCALE`), lowered so its lensed top stays in the Zoom 3 frame, and its accretion disk tilted 0.2 rad (`HOLE_TILT`, right side dipping): every pixel is taken back into the disk's own frame, so the streak pattern, the front and back halves and the lensed arc tilt together. The drifting fragments of the nine earlier worlds are torn-off islands built with the Shattered Sky's `island()` in each world's own colours (`FRAGMENT_PAL`), each carrying a proper landmark: Thornwick's windmill with its sails turning, a moss-hung Mirewood cypress, a Cinderpass cone with lava running down it, two snowy Rimeholt pines, Amarath columns under a broken arch, a Duskspire tower with its crystal turning, the Bonefields' greatsword driven into a giant's skull (a 13×12 pixel map, `SKULL`: lit dome, a crack from the crown, deep sockets with the Void glinting violet in them, teeth over the jaw), a Shattered Sky pine with water pouring off the edge, and a slab of the Brink shedding stones. The black mirror in front became a river of void (`voidRiver`): bands of violet and rose flowing past on the loop with stars caught in the current; it no longer reflects, so the scene sets no `water` |

### Open

- **Zoom 3 is the chosen camera** (2026-09-25): closer than the original while a large boss still fits. The other cameras stay on the Live stage for comparison. Pixel Crusade's other half of item 5, darker scenes behind the fighters, hasn't been tried: World 1's bright afternoon was the user's choice.

- **World 1 is done and locked** (see §1). The backgrounds of Worlds 2–10 are locked (fourth pass, Rounds 1–7). **Still round-1 art:** the enemies and bosses of Worlds 2–10 and the other 58 VFX. On the stage the old enemies look undersized next to the chibi Heroes and Champions.
- **Champion casts are still chassis-level.** Round 5 restyled the bodies, not the 7 ability effects; the chassis clips are shared per archetype, so two Champions of one archetype still swing identically.
- **Only four skills are cinematics.** The other 12 classes cast with a sprite-level effect (aura, bolt, shout, slam, light column), not a `CinematicVfx`. Their skill VFX are still round-1 in `vfx.ts`.
- **The classic skill VFX still exist.** The four cinematic skills override their old `vfx.ts` definitions by ID (`CINEMATIC_BY_ID`). Delete those once every skill is a cinematic.
- **Exports are stale** (see §1).

## 4. Characters: the chibi body

`chibi.ts` holds the body, `hero-kit.ts` the shared kit (`chibiLook`, `aura` and its colour ramps, `bowAttack`/`loose`, `shout`, `slam`, `lightColumn`, `chibiCape`), and `heroes-warrior.ts`, `heroes-mage.ts` and `heroes-archer.ts` the classes, one file per class line. `heroes.ts` merges them into `HERO_ART` and derives the Move state. A Look opts in with `body: drawChibi`. It rides the same `HP` pose parameters and resolves the same joints (`J`) as the classic rig, so clips, `Look.fx` painters and the VFX layer work unchanged.

**Proportions,** in a 64×64 frame with the feet at y = 58, about 24 px tall:
- Legs 5 px (`CHIBI_LEG`): 3 px columns, 4–5 px boots.
- Torso 10 wide × 8 tall, 7 rows to the hip (`CHIBI_TORSO`). Shoulders at ±3.
- Head about 12 × 11, sitting 1 row into the torso.
- Arms 3 px thick with 3×3 fists. Sleeve colour for the first 60%, then the cuff or skin.
- The outline is added at stamp time (`StampStyle.outline = C.ink`). Never draw it into the sprite.

**Heads are pixel maps** (`head(rows, neckCol, eyeCol)`, keys in `HEAD_KEY`):
- Build a class head as its headgear rows followed by `...face(padL, padR)`. The six face rows are the rookie's face: fringe, eye, nose, plaster.
- Heads are **bottom-aligned**: the eye sits 6 rows and the mouth 3 rows from the bottom in every head, so `chibiHead` can animate them by coordinate (squint on hurt, mouth open, glowing eyes on cast).
- Headgear by class: bare mop (Beginner, Mage, Archer), kettle cap (Warrior), horned iron cap (Barbarian), wild hair under a red bandana (Berserker), plumed bascinet with cheek guards (Knight), steel helm with a gold brow cross (Paladin), tall starred blue hat (Wizard), red hat with the tip folded back (Sorcerer, the video's fire witch), feathered headband (Shaman), horned bone mask pushed up (Witch Doctor), peaked cap with a red feather (Bowman), charcoal wide brim with a white plume (Marksman), fox-eared hood (Hunter), wolf-head hood (Beast Master).
- Wider headgear pads the face with `face(l, r)`, which shifts the neck and eye columns by `l`. Cheek guards and pelts replace the face rows' hair columns by hand (Knight, Beast Master).
- **Keep the face clear.** Weapons draw after the head, so a shouldered great axe or an upright hammer covers the face. Rest them upright in front of the face (Barbarian) or head-down (Paladin). Pauldrons sit at the shoulder row, never above it, or they land on the chin.

**Animation beats:**
- **Idle:** a 1 px bob over 1.2–1.6 s.
- **Attack:** wind-up (Charge), strike (Cast, where the game fires the hit), then Recover. About 0.9 s.
- **Cast:** 1.4–2.0 s. A clear raised pose held while the VFX plays: staff up, sword up, drawn bow.
- **Hit and death:** `hitClip` and `deathClip`.
- Melee uses `crescent()`: a filled arc about 6 px thick, tapering at both ends, with a white outer edge. Never a 1 px arc.
- Casts wear a **flame aura** (`aura()`): tongues rising along both flanks, never over the face, cooling through the skill's colour ramp.
- Keep everything inside the 64 px frame. The facing side has 32 px of room, so projectiles belong in the VFX, not the sprite.

## 5. Skill VFX: the cinematic recipe

`vfx-cinematic.ts`. Each effect is a `CinematicVfx`: a normal `VfxDef` plus `cinematic: { hits, tint, spread }`. Effects are drawn in the VL layout (160×88, floor at y = 80, caster at x = 46, foes at x = 104, 124, 144), as pure functions of time.

**The beats, in order:**
1. `casterRing()` from the first frame: two slanted ellipse rings with runes turning between them. It grows in over 0.2 s, holds, and shrinks out, with light rising off it.
2. The main effect, **big and filled**: `meteor()` out of a `skyPortal()`, a `cyclone()`, a beam, a light pillar.
3. Every impact is `blast()`:
   - a white flash disc on the first frame;
   - a `blob()` with a boiling noisy edge, the core cooling out through a 6-step ramp (white → hot → bright → mid → deep → rim), hashed holes eating it away as it ages;
   - a thin white `shockRing()` just outside it;
   - sparks thrown up that fall under gravity.
4. The aftermath lingers: `groundFire()` for a burn, embers, motes.

**Timing and targets:**
- Effects run 1.8–2.6 s.
- `hits` lists the seconds at which each impact lands. The live stage uses them to land damage and stack numbers, so they must match the drawing.
- `spread: true` walks the hits along the enemy line (Meteor Shower). `false` keeps them all on the **front** target, which is where the stage lands single-target damage.
- Match the skill's content definition: Whirlwind reaches the front line only, Kill Shot is a single guaranteed crit, Meteor Shower hits every enemy and leaves a burn, Haste buffs only the caster.

**Stage presentation** (`presentation.ts`, driven by `demo.ts`):
- **Banner:** `drawSkillBanner`. Gold gradient letters in the 5×7 font (bright top, deep base) with an ink outline and a brown drop shadow. Gold rules shoot outward over 0.2 s, and the first frame flashes white.
- **Tint:** `tintLut(tint)`, which is `shadeLut(0.55, tint, 0.2)`, stepped in and out through Bayer dither. Use `dusk0` (plum) for red and fire skills and `night0` for gold buffs. Tinting toward `red0` turns the scene muddy brown.
- **Other units hold** while a hero skill has the stage.
- **Numbers:** hit numbers are held (1.8 s, no float) and stack 7 px apart over each target. After the last hit, a big red total goes on top. Styles are in `NUMBER_STYLES` (`feedback.ts`), and every number uses **one typeface**: the 3×5 font for hits, heals and misses, and its 5×7 **mid cut** for crits and totals — the same letterforms at about 1.5×, drawn by hand with two-pixel stems, one-pixel horizontals and two pixels between glyphs. A straight 2× read far too big once the stage was scaled up, and a 1.5× stretch of the 3×5 would give uneven strokes. Each is filled with a vertical gradient from a white-hot top (`textRamp` in `font.ts`, the skill banner's treatment) inside an ink outline: gold for hits, red for crits, green for heals, steel for misses. A new number shows solid white for its first 0.05 s; a crit lands with a 2 px hop for 0.1 s. Floating numbers scatter a few pixels so a burst of hits doesn't print on one spot. Round 1 used two typefaces (3×5 for hits, 5×7 for crits), which made them read as unrelated.
- The gallery previews each cinematic on `cinematicStage()`: the caster idling and a scarecrow on each enemy mark.

### 5a. The live stage's hit feel (Round 1)

Taken from the pixel-crusade branch (`engine.ts`, `pixel.ts`), whose art isn't sharper (it is 256×144 on the same palette) but presents every hit. Tuned in `JUICE` at the top of `demo.ts`.

- **Two clocks.** Bodies play their held 10 fps frames. Everything that flies (projectiles, particles, VFX, shake) and the scenery move at 60 Hz: the stage sets `clock.smooth` (`vfx-kit.ts`) around its own draw calls, which takes `qt()` off the frame grid. Exports and the gallery never set it, so baked strips still close their loops.
- **Scaled for a crowd.** Twelve bodies trading blows would stutter the scene if every hit froze it. An ordinary hit only holds the striker (melee) and the target for 3 ticks (5 on a crit), and the target jumps straight to its white flash frame and shudders 1 px. The scene-wide freeze is kept for a kill (3 ticks, then no ordinary kill may freeze again for `FREEZE_GAP`), every impact of a Hero skill, the last kill of a wave (plus slow motion) and a boss kill (freeze, 4 px shake, flash, slow motion). Screen shake on a crit is the Hero's alone. Measured over 3 minutes: the stage is frozen about 4% of the time and shaking about 12%.
- **Death shatters.** A body plays its authored stagger and fall, then breaks into 2×2 chunks of its own colours (never its ink outline) at the frame where it would start to dissolve, behind a white-and-gold kill ring.
- **Rim light** in the unit's accent (red for enemies) on the edge facing the foe while winding up and striking. It only lights edges at least 2 px thick, so baked aura flames and sparks don't turn into stripes. **Afterimages**: two checker silhouettes behind a caster for the first 0.25 s of its strike.
- **Projectiles.** Ranged units (the Archer and Mage lines, support and control Champions, staff and bow enemies) loose arrows that fly an arc and bolts that trail particles. The hit lands on arrival; a multi-strike volley looses one arrow per strike, 0.3 s apart.
- **Flash** is a Bayer-dithered overlay, capped at 6/16 coverage: half coverage washed a boss kill out.

## 6. Backgrounds

`scenery-kit.ts` holds the canvas and loop constants, the layer primitives and the shared props; `scenery.ts` holds World 1 and the `WORLD_SCENES` registry (and re-exports the kit); `scenery-a.ts` holds Worlds 2–5 and `scenery-b.ts` Worlds 6–10. A world is a `WorldScene` (`draw`, and optionally `water`, `glitter`, `tiered`). Canvas 320×180, fighters stand at `FLOOR_Y = 150`.

**The shared layout** (every world from 2 on, taken from World 1): the field runs from `GROUND = 110` to `LIP = FLOOR_Y + 10`, which holds the three ranks (rear on y 122, near on 154) with room at both ends; every backdrop prop roots at or above `GROUND`, so nothing stands behind a fighter but ground; the foreground starts at `FRONT = FLOOR_Y + 15`. Parallax: sky and celestials fixed, far layers 0.04–0.1, mid 0.15–0.3, the props along the field's edge 0.4–0.6, the field itself 0.6 at its far edge to 1.0 at the near one (`scatter`, `flagstones`), and framing at full scroll through `framing()`, which lays it on `SCROLL_PERIOD`. **Framing goes in the scene's `front()`, never in `draw()`:** it is rooted in front of the near rank, so the live stage draws it over the fighters (tinted with the rest of the scene during a cinematic, and mirrored in the water), and `composeScene()` stacks it for stills. Drawn in `draw()` it sat behind every body while standing in front of them. The stage snaps `scroll` to the period when a march ends; before that, each march's last tick overshot by up to a frame and the framing crept onto the fight over a long session. The fight-band spec checks `draw()` only, since `front()` is not behind anyone. Keep the inner framing element between x 26 and 56 (or 264 and 294): Zoom 3 crops x < 29 and x > 301.

**Layering, back to front** (World 1 is the model):
1. Sky bands with 4-row dither seams.
2. The sun: a soft dither glow, the disc, a white core.
3. Streak clouds, lit from below, each one band lighter than the sky behind it.
4. Far ridge in atmospheric blue.
5. Nearer hills.
6. Treeline.
7. Landmarks: windmills.
8. Hedgerows.
9. **Framing pines at both edges** (x < 40 and x > 280, clear of the fighters).
10. The grass bank.
11. Water.

**Rules:**
- **The loop must close.** A background is `BG_FRAMES = 16` frames (`BG_LOOP = 1.6 s`). Write motion as the phase `t / BG_LOOP`, with a whole number of cycles per loop: the windmills turn a quarter per loop (4 symmetric sails), waves do one sine cycle, fireflies circle closed paths. Anything that can't close in 1.6 s stays still in the baked loop and moves only on the live stage, under `clock.smooth`: drifting clouds, birds, shoals, lava crusts, wind streaks. `motes()` does both: drifting particles live, small closed loops baked. A plume climbs one puff slot per loop. Check that frame 16 is pixel-identical to frame 0.
- **Water:** `reflectWater(s, top, t, glitterX)`. It mirrors the scene above the waterline, foreshortened (`REFLECT_SQUASH = 2.2` rows of scene per row of water, so a shallow pond still shows sky), sheared by depth, darkened with a `shadeLut`, and adds ripple streaks and a sun glitter road. Set `water` on the scene and the live stage re-runs it after drawing units, so the fighters reflect too. **The user likes the water. Keep it.**
- **Lighting sells separation.** World 1's sun sits low behind the hedgerows, so they are painted **backlit**: cool dark bodies with a thin warm rim on their sunward tops. That is physically right, and it keeps them darker than the fighters.
- **World 1, Thornwick Vale,** was decided with the user: **late afternoon with a partly blue sky.** Night was rejected, then sunset, in favour of earlier in the day. Blue top warming through salmon to gold at the horizon, clouds lit from below, the sun above the hills, a millpond in front.

## 7. Palette: two tiers

`palette.ts`, 102 colours. Index 0 is transparent.

- **Character tier:** everything not in `SCENERY_RAMPS`. Saturated and bright: heroes, Champions, enemies, bosses, effects, UI.
- **Scenery tier:** `SCENERY_RAMPS`, dark → light. Duller and darker than its character-tier cousins, with shadows leaning cool and highlights leaning warm. The ramps are `moss`, `lagoon`, `slate`, `heather`, `rust`, `rock`, `sand`, `ice` (4 steps each), `sky` (3) and `dusk` (4).
- **Adding a colour:** it joins a named ramp, in dark → light order. Never add a one-off. Add new entries at the end of `HEX` so existing indices never change.
- **Remaps** (reflections, tints) come from `shadeLut(mul, tint, amount)`. It snaps to the nearest palette entry, so dark, dull scenery colours give better results than saturated ones.

**The fight-band rule.** A world with `tiered: true` paints the band behind the fighters (the `FIGHT_BAND = 28` rows above the floor) in **scenery colours only**, and at most **5%** of that band may sit within an RGB distance of 40 of its enemy's mid/light skin, pants or arm colours.

Why that shape of rule: "background darker than the enemies" is wrong for near-black enemies (Duskspire, The Void), and a brightness rule would not have caught the original problem. The Bramble Goblins stood in front of hedges painted in their exact greens.

**Specs** (`test/hero-quest/art.spec.ts`):
- Every scenery ramp is ordered dark → light.
- **No character sprite ever uses a scenery colour.**
- Every tiered world satisfies the fight-band rule. The failure names the offending colour and pixel.
- Every `ART_ROUNDS` prefix matches a real asset.

**To move a world onto the tier:** repaint everything in its fight band in scenery ramps, choosing hues away from its enemy, then set `tiered: true`. The spec tells you when it passes. The gallery's **Palette** sheets (`ui/palette/scenery`, `ui/palette/characters`) show both tiers side by side.
