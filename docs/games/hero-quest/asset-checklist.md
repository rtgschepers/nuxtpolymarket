# Hero Quest — Asset Checklist

One checkbox per deliverable, itemised from `asset-list.md` and the live content modules
(`shared/utils/hero-quest/content/`), 2026-09-17. **`asset-list.md` stays the source of truth for
*why* each count is what it is** — every fidelity decision, chassis/skin rule and open question
lives there and is not repeated here. This file is only the tick-list.

Names come from the code, so they are the names that ship. IDs are stable and saves reference
them — a rename here is display-only, a rename in content is not (`CLAUDE.md` §3).

**Legend:** 🎞️ = animated spritesheet · 🖼️ = static image/icon

and all four weapon variants, so the player learns it once. No animation of its own.

- [ ] Elite visual mark — single treatment, reused everywhere

**Bosses (10 designs × 5 states = 50 spritesheets).** The fifth state is an Entry, not a cast —
the boss arriving. Drop to 4 if it does not earn its keep in playtest (`asset-list.md` §1.4).

No reuse between them, and none with the campaign roster. (`asset-list.md` §1.5)

- [ ] Guild Raid boss — `solo_boss`
- [ ] Training Grounds Raid boss — `solo_boss` — same fight type as the Guild Raid, still a fully separate design
- [ ] Dig-site Raid boss — `reinforced_boss` — plus its own add-wave enemy designs (count not yet specified)
- [ ] Forge Raid boss — `phased_boss` — needs a visually distinct state per HP-threshold phase
- [ ] Trait Raid boss — `rampaging_boss` — unkillable, so no death animation ever plays; needs its own visual language with no HP bar (`raid-system.md` §7)

### 1.6 Arena Training Dummy 🎞️ — 1 animation

- [ ] Training dummy — static pose 🖼️
- [ ] Training dummy — hit reaction 🎞️ (no idle loop, no attack of its own)

---

## 2. Combat VFX & Feedback

### 2.1 Ability VFX 🎞️ — 62 custom sets

Custom VFX animation per ability, no shared template library at this stage. **The matching icons
are counted in §3.1** — tick them there, not here.

**Hero class skills (16)**

**Training Grounds Actives (18).** Decided 2026-09-17: same custom-per-ability treatment as Hero
skills — sharing VFX would make a pulled Skill look like a skin of something already owned. The
18 Passives need nothing; they have no cast moment.

- [ ] Quick Strike — Common  `skill_quick_strike`
- [ ] Steadying Breath — Common  `skill_steadying_breath`
- [ ] Coin Toss — Common  `skill_coin_toss`
- [ ] Focused Blow — Uncommon  `skill_focused_blow`

### 2.2 Multi-Strike Animation 🎞️ — 2 recolors

- [ ] Hunter triple-strike — recolor of the Archer-path single-strike, fired 3×
- [ ] Beast Master quad-strike — recolor of the Archer-path single-strike, fired 4×

### 2.3 Other Feedback

**Status effect icons 🖼️ — ~15–20 types.** `asset-list.md` §2.3 gives a range, not a count; the ten
named types are below and the remainder lands when the range is settled. **This set is *not* in the
217-icon total** for the same reason.

- [ ] Status icon — Burn / DoT
- [ ] Status icon — Stun
- [ ] Status icon — Slow
- [ ] Status icon — Silence
- [ ] Status icon — Armor shred
- [ ] Status icon — Curse
- [ ] Status icon — Shield
- [ ] Status icon — Buff
- [ ] Status icon — Debuff-immunity
- [ ] Status icon — Evasion
- [ ] Status icons — settle the 15–20 range, then itemise the remainder

**Everything else**

- [ ] Damage number style 🖼️ — normal hit
- [ ] Damage number style 🖼️ — crit hit
- [ ] Damage number style 🖼️ — heal
- [ ] Damage number style 🖼️ — miss / evasion text
- [ ] HP bar + party frame 🖼️ — portrait, HP, active status icons, per party member
- [ ] Cooldown radial-fill overlay 🖼️ — per equipped skill icon
- [ ] Boss enrage-timer UI 🖼️ — 3 of the 4 raid fight types
- [ ] Reinforced Boss add-wave spawn VFX 🎞️ — Dig-site Raid
- [ ] Phased Boss phase-transition VFX 🎞️ — Forge Raid

> Artifact proc feedback was **cut** 2026-09-17 — log-only, no art. Nothing to build.

## 3. Static Icons 🖼️ — 217

### 3.1 Ability & Skill Icons — 80

an icon; only the 18 Actives also need VFX (§2.1).

## 4. Backgrounds & Environments

### 4.1 World backgrounds — 10

One per world, drawn from the same theme line as that world's roster. **Art direction still owed**
(`open-items.md` #6) — the count and fidelity are not in question, the direction is.

- [ ] 1. Thornwick Vale — *Frontier farmland at the edge of the kingdom, where the first cracks have turned the hedgerows feral.*
- [ ] 2. Mirewood — *A drowned forest of black water and hanging moss, rotting from the roots up.*
- [ ] 3. Cinderpass — *A volcanic mountain pass choked with ash, held by kobold clans and the thing they worship.*
- [ ] 4. Rimeholt — *A frozen northern hold whose raiders swore themselves to a cold that does not end.*
- [ ] 5. Sunken Amarath — *The drowned capital of a sea-empire, its dead still keeping the tides.*
- [ ] 6. Duskspire — *A city of mage-towers held at twilight since its archmage opened a door to the Void.*
- [ ] 7. The Bonefields — *An ancient battlefield where the fallen of a forgotten war rise to fight it again.*
- [ ] 8. The Shattered Sky — *Islands of torn-loose stone adrift in a storm the Void has unmoored.*
- [ ] 9. The Brink — *The last ground at the edge of the world, where the storm has burned out, the sky has gone to stars and everything left is falling toward the Void.*
- [ ] 10. The Void — *Nothing, pressing in — where every crack leads, and where each run ends before it begins again.*

### 4.2 UI backgrounds — 11

- [ ] Stage-select / world map UI

**Tab backgrounds (10).** Built, from `app/pages/hero-quest.vue`:

- [ ] Battle tab background
- [ ] Gacha tab background

- [ ] Prestige tab background
- [ ] Wiki tab background

**Phase 4, not yet built:**

- [ ] Raids tab background
- [ ] Traits tab background
- [ ] Arena tab background
- [ ] Leaderboard tab background

> The Dev tab is development-only and needs no art.

### 4.3 Gacha reveal — 7

- [ ] Gacha reveal — Common recolor
- [ ] Gacha reveal — Uncommon recolor
- [ ] Gacha reveal — Rare recolor
- [ ] Gacha reveal — Epic recolor

---

- [ ] Loadout save-slot cards — 2→10 slots
- [ ] Trait slot UI — 5 fixed slots, roll and lock states
- [ ] Arena candidate cards

---

## 6. Branding

- [ ] Hero Quest logo
- [ ] App icon
- [ ] Splash / loading screen

> ⚠ Trademark: HeroQuest is an existing, actively-republished board game with mobile ports.
> Worth resolving **before** these three are produced.

---

## 7. Blocked, contingent or on hold

Not counted above. Each is waiting on a decision, not on production capacity.

- [ ] **Training Grounds recruitment art (0–3)** — Barracks / Archery Range / Wizard Tower. `trainingGroundsArt` is still serialized and nothing renders it since #20 removed the page. Either the Gacha card grows a per-system art treatment, or the field goes. **Decide during the Pixi pass — do not commission until then.**
- [ ] **Enemy fifth animation state (+24 sets)** — only if the enemy-kit question (`open-items.md` #6) is answered yes: 4 more trash sets and 20 more boss sets. A gameplay decision whose art cost has never been priced into the kit discussion.
- [ ] **Dig-site Raid add-wave enemies (count TBD)** — §1.5 names them but no roster size exists yet.
- [ ] **Status effect icons beyond the named ten (~5–10)** — settle the 15–20 range in `asset-list.md` §2.3.
- [ ] **World background art direction** — the one line in `asset-list.md` still owing direction rather than production.
