# Design Doc Index

Master navigation for the project. **26 files**: 18 design docs (all **Locked** except `idea-backlog.md`, a running list), 7 project-meta docs catalogued in §1a, and `CLAUDE.md`. *Refreshed 2026-09-15 against the built game; the folder is gitignored and local.*

> **Read first:** `open-items.md` lists everything still open — design questions, undesigned passes, and the standing constant-tuning list. Anything below marked ⚠️ points at a section where code has overridden a locked doc; `open-items.md`'s precedence table records each (#17, #18.2, #20, #23, #25, #29).
>
> **`build-log.md` is the record of what landed** and why it was built that way — split out of `open-items.md` on 2026-09-17. It is **not** on the per-task reading list: read an entry when you need the reasoning behind something already built, never to find out what to do next. A bare `#N` resolves to `open-items.md` first, `build-log.md` otherwise.

## 1a. Project-Meta Docs

Not design docs — they describe the *state* of the project rather than the game. Unnumbered deliberately, so the dependency numbering above stays stable.

| Doc | Owns | When to read it |
|---|---|---|
| `index.md` | This file — catalog, topic lookup, currency/formula indexes, roster sizes | Any time you need to find where something is specified |
| `open-items.md` | Every open question, undesigned pass, and untuned constant, plus the precedence table for code that overrides a locked doc. **The freshest doc in the project**, and now only what is still open | Before implementing anything numeric or contested; before starting a design session |
| `build-log.md` | What landed and why — the numbered record #4–#29, split out of `open-items.md` 2026-09-17 | Only when you need the reasoning behind something already built. **Never to decide what to do next** |
| `implementation-plan.md` | 5-phase build order, per-phase scope + deferral lists, how to brief Claude Code | Before writing any code |
| `asset-list.md` | Full art/VFX/icon/background production list — **every count is now a number** (2026-09-17) | Art production planning. Enemy variants, styling and animation states closed 2026-09-17; only world-background art direction is still owed. An enemy-kit yes (#6) would add a fifth state to every enemy rig |
| `asset-checklist.md` | The same production list, itemised — **665 checkboxes**, one per deliverable, named from the live content modules (2026-09-17) | Tracking art production. Generated from `asset-list.md`, which stays the source of truth for *why* each count is what it is; regenerate if a roster or a count moves |
| `playtest-notes.md` | Raw session observations, the sim's falsifiable predictions, and what is known-inert so it isn't chased | While playing; and before any tuning pass, since it holds the *why* behind what `open-items.md` decided |
| `sim-tool.md` | `sim:hero-quest` and `balance:hero-quest` usage — reports, flags, overrides, sweeps, caveats | Before measuring or tuning anything |
| `idle-game-architecture.md` | The polynux idle-game platform conventions this slice inherits | When a platform convention is in question |

`CLAUDE.md` is the implementation brief for Claude Code, loaded from the repo root's `CLAUDE.md`.

## 6. What's Still Genuinely Undesigned

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| **World & enemy design** (10 worlds, names, art, enemy rosters, boss identities, enemy kits) | The single biggest remaining greenfield pass. No longer blocks Gold (`gold-economy.md` §3a) |
| **Passive Skill Tree** | `idea-backlog.md` item 3 — unchecked, no raid assigned |
| ~~**Alternative enemy-scaling formula**~~ | Applied — the continuous `b^n` curve (`open-items.md` #10) |
| **Holiday gameplay events** (limited-time modes) | Explicitly deferred in `holiday-events.md` |
| **Per-raid mechanic content** | Fight types locked, specifics deferred |
| **Remaining tuning** | Combat/progression tuned (#22); 62 `// UNTUNED ╧` constants remain, mostly gacha, shop, economy and ability magnitudes — see `open-items.md`, "Standing numeric tuning" |
| **Gold decisions** | First-week income, lost calendar anchors, stale Seal ladder — `open-items.md` #23 |
