# What still needs attention

**Only open items live here.** Refreshed 2026-09-17, against the code on the `hero-quest` branch.
Everything that landed moved to `build-log.md` on that date — this doc had reached 604 lines of
which the large majority was a record of finished work, and it is on the always-read list, which
made it the most expensive bloat in the project.

**Item numbers are the originals and are never reused.** Eleven docs, `constants.ts` and two
scripts cite them (`#22`, `#23.3`, `#18.6`). The gaps below — #4, #5, #8, #10–#21, #24, #26–#28 —
are finished items, not missing ones; they are in `build-log.md` under the same number. #22, #23,
#25 and #29 appear in both: the open part here, the full record there.

**Resolving a bare `#N`:** this doc first, `build-log.md` otherwise. Sub-numbers (`#23.3`,
`#18.6`) keep their original meaning in both.

**These docs live in `docs/games/hero-quest/`.** Nothing but these files records the reasoning
behind the decisions in them.

## ⚖️ Precedence — where the code overrides a locked doc

The standing rule is that a contradiction gets recorded, never silently reconciled, and that this
doc wins over a system doc. These are the live overrides; each links its full record. **If you
read the older rule in the doc named in the middle column, it is superseded.**

| # | The locked doc still says | What is true |
|---|---|---|
| 17 | `CLAUDE.md` §6: Champion names are deferred, do not generate them | All 48 exist, assembled from two tables. The guidance was updated rather than left contradicting the code |
| 18.2 | "do not generate 48 Artifact names" | Named 2026-09-15, `artifacts-dig-site-gacha.md` §3a |
| 20 | `gear-equipment.md` §6, `skills-gacha.md` §1 and both gacha docs describe four gacha **tabs** the player visits | Collapsed to **Gacha + Collections**. Navigation only — no rule, formula, drop table or number moved. `trainingGroundsArt` is serialized and rendered nowhere |
| 23 | `gold-economy.md` §9's prestige→calendar anchors; ~235M/hr at month 3 | Gold is paced on **wall-clock account age**. The anchors are gone. Still open below |
| 25 | `core-progression-and-prestige.md` §2 and `idle-mechanics.md` §5: a failed boss is re-engaged **manually** | Bosses engage **automatically** while `document.visibilityState` is `visible`. A hidden tab, a closed app and an offline settle never engage one, so Void Shards still cannot come from idle time. The 400 on an early client engage is routine — **do not soften it server-side** |
| 29 | `economy-and-currencies.md` §5 source 2: a time-gated free Seal grant | **Removed.** Free Seals come only from milestones and (later) raid clears; the free 10-pull entitlement is the only thing a clock hands out |

## 🔷 Open questions — need your input

### 1. Should Arena get its own preferred-Loadout auto-apply for attacking?
Every raid auto-applies a preferred Loadout on engage (`loadouts.md` §4). Arena still doesn't — the attacker fights with whatever's live, manually pre-swapped if desired. `arena.md`'s Implementation Note flags this as a natural extension, not yet requested.

### 2. Arena matchmaking band width
`ARENA_MATCH_BAND_PCT` — how close in GPN does an opponent need to be to appear as a real candidate before Training Dummy fills the slot? Design-feel question as much as a number.

### 3. Boss/Raid fight crit model — seeded or averaged?
`tech-architecture.md` §4c/§9 recommends seeded RNG crits for live boss and raid fights, but it's a recommendation, not a lock. **As built, boss fights roll seeded crits** (`fight.ts`). The question is whether that stays — with `BOSS_HP_MULT` sized so gates are not decided within a couple of seconds, the variance matters less than it did.

---

## 🔴 Genuinely undesigned — full passes, not edits

### 6. World & enemy design — **naming pass landed 2026-09-15; art and enemy kits still open**

**Names, themes and rosters are done** (`shared/utils/hero-quest/content/worlds.ts`, `core-progression-and-prestige.md` §5). The run is a walk toward the source: Duskspire's archmage opened a door to the Void (World 6), the cracks spread outward, and a run starts at the far frontier and walks inward past the door and out through the edge of the world into The Void. Each world has a one-line theme, which is the art brief. Nothing numeric moved — enemy stats come only from the curve.

Three naming rules, because the UI depends on them, stated in the `worlds.ts` header: trash names pluralise with a plain "s" ("Bramble Goblins defeated" — documented, not tested), boss names never start with "The" (the button reads "Fight Old Gnarlhide"; it previously rendered "Fight the The Voidborn"), and no name reuses a Champion given name or title (six of the old placeholders did). `worlds.spec.ts` enforces the last two, plus unique names across worlds. World IDs were renamed to match (`world_thornwick_vale` …); nothing persists them — runs store the world as an integer.

**Still open:** art direction and production (`asset-list.md` §1.4 enemies, world backgrounds), and whether enemies get kits of their own — the one part of this pass that would change gameplay. Enemies are still HP/PWR/DEF stat blocks with no abilities, which is why `controlResist` is inert (#18.6). *(This no longer blocks Gold: `gold-economy.md` §9's prestige→calendar calibration was replaced by the account-age ceiling, #23.)*

**What the tuning pass (#22) hands the enemy-kit question:** the enemy *curve* is tuned and derived from a pacing model, so art and kits can be chosen without re-deciding numbers — but anything that changes fight length (enemy abilities, heals, shields, more escort bodies) moves `FIGHT_LENGTH_DRIFT`'s effective value and has to be re-measured on the campaign walk. A first prestige for a party of three is about a week, and a world takes from under an hour (World 1–2) to about two days (World 10), almost all of it grind in front of gates.

### 7. Passive Skill Tree (backlog item 3)
Unchecked. Hero-only passive tree, generic root splitting into 3 paths, nodes up to 5 levels each, purchased via its own dedicated raid, with Champion/item side-nodes allowed but never gating a path. Structurally sound to build (raids don't have to be gacha-paired) but has had no dedicated design session.

### 9. Holiday gameplay events
Explicitly deferred scope — the gift-mechanic phase is locked, but limited-time modes/content were never started.

---

## ⚠️ Open consequences of work that landed

Three items are built and working but left something undecided. The full record of each is in
`build-log.md`; only the open half is restated here. (The `killFraction` invariant that used to
sit here as #24 is not an open item — it is a trap, and it lives in `CLAUDE.md` §7 and
`build-log.md` #24.)

### 22. The combat and progression tuning pass — three open consequences

Full record: `build-log.md` #22. 42 constants moved to `// TUNED ✓` and the level curve was
re-derived as a pacing model. What it left open:

1. **A solo account never completes a prestige** without pulling. That follows from making the
   boss gate the wall and Champions the answer to it — worth confirming it is intended rather
   than letting it stand by default.
2. **The Gold curve was calibrated against the old loop speed** — see #23.
3. **`STAT_PACES_ENEMY_CURVE` is inert while `XP_PACE_SLACK` is 1.0**, because both stat curves
   are then numerically identical. Keep it: it starts mattering the moment slack moves.

⚠ The `TUNED ✓` legend says "confirmed in playtest", but `playtest-notes.md` records only
session 1. The block was tuned on the campaign sim, not felt.

### 23. Gold — the progression half is still open

Full record, including the 2026-09-16 measurement pass and the ceiling regeneration:
`build-log.md` #23. Where it stands:

**Done.** `GOLD_TENURE_CEILING` is regenerated against `GOLD_REFERENCE_KILLS_PER_HOUR = 600`,
measured on the campaign walk, instead of the `MIN_SECONDS_PER_KILL` throughput floor it used to
assume. Every rung went up 12×. `bun run balance:compare --emit-hq-ceiling` regenerates it.

**Still open. The sub-numbers are unchanged** — `#23.1`, `#23.2` and `#23.3` are cited from
`playtest-notes.md`, `gold-economy.md` and `constants.ts`:

1. **The locked calendar anchors are gone.** `gold-economy.md` locked ~235M/hr at month 3 and
   ~0.71B/hr at month 6; the ceiling pays ~28M/hr at day 90 and ~52M/hr at day 180. A deliberate
   re-anchoring on the platform that replaced a *locked* decision in code — recorded here so it
   reads as a decision rather than a drift.
2. **The Seal ladder's calibration is stale**, and measured, worse than stale: at present income
   the first 1,000,000-Gold rung is **33.8 days** away, so re-deriving `SEAL_LADDER_GROWTH`
   against income that size is meaningless. **Blocked on 23.3, not parallel to it.** #29 raised
   the stakes — the ladder is now the only non-milestone Seal source.
3. **First-week income — the actual decision.** The walk is **progression-bound end to end** and
   earns 1,233 Gold/hour, 0.07% of platform; raising a ceiling that never binds changed its
   income by nothing. The two levers that reach that region are `BASE_GOLD` and `GOLD_STEP_BASE`,
   and the regeneration gave them room they did not have — the walk now saturates at 138.8M
   rather than 11.57M, with the saturation point at 1.09 rather than 1.07. **Nothing has been
   moved** pending the call: should a first-week account earn near platform rates, or is low
   early Gold acceptable given that Gold only buys Seals? Note that `GOLD_PLATFORM_DISCOUNT`'s
   "~89% of time ceiling-bound" figure is **0%** for the first month-plus.

⚠ **The abuse bound is now explicit.** With the ceiling generated at 600 kills/hour and the floor
still allowing 7,200, the worst case is **12× platform**. **Battle Speed (Phase 4, unbuilt)
multiplies straight through it**, with no second ceiling underneath.

⚠ **`gold-economy.md` §9.4's safety margin dropped an order of magnitude** with the regeneration:
the largest single collect clears the `numeric(19,4)` column by two orders rather than three
(187 consecutive worst-case collects fill it, not 2,250). `settle.spec.ts` asserts the new figure
and says why.

### 29. Free Seals — the un-re-derived half

Full record: `build-log.md` #29. A gacha gets 30 free pulls a day and no free Seals, ×4 systems.
The 30/day ceiling for a player who never buys Seals is **intended and accepted**. What has not
been re-derived against the new shape: the collection curve, Essence income and the crafting
economy — a tuning question, listed below rather than a blocker.

---

## ⚪ Standing numeric tuning — **what is still `// UNTUNED ╧`**

Named constants with a formula shape locked and a placeholder value. Consolidated so a tuning pass has one list. `rg '╧' shared/utils/hero-quest/constants.ts` is the authority — **61 markers** as of 2026-09-16 (three Seal-grant constants deleted and two free-pull constants promoted to `TUNED ✓` by #29; `GPN_DISPLAY_SCALE` added by #28).

~~**Decided: none of this is tuned before playtesting.**~~ **Superseded for the combat and progression block by #22**, which tuned it on the campaign walk. The original reasoning still holds for everything that remains below: the balance script and campaign sim project *what the formulas say*, and a projected value that feels wrong in play is worth less than no value, because it looks settled. What remains is mostly the gacha, shop and ability-magnitude layers, which the campaign walk barely exercises — so they want play data or a different measurement, not another sim pass.

**Do not treat any of these as blocking a phase.**

Two rows are not constants in the strict sense: the archetype stat spreads are a table, and `SEAL_LADDER_BASE_GOLD` *is* specified. Both are listed anyway because the same pass answers them.

**Removed from this table**, so they are not re-added by mistake — now `TUNED ✓`, derived, or deleted (#22, #23, #29): `SEAL_GRANT_INTERVAL_HOURS`, `SEAL_GRANT_AMOUNT`, `SEAL_GRANT_BANK_CAP_DAYS`, `FREE_PULLS_PER_DAY`, `FREE_PULL_COOLDOWN_MINUTES`, `K`, `CRIT_CHANCE_PER_POINT`, `CRIT_DAMAGE_PER_POINT`, `SKILL_BASE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`, `SKILL_BASE_ABILITY_MULTIPLIER`, `WAVE_PACK_SIZE`, `ELITE_PACK_SIZE`, `PACK_LIVE_STREAM_FRACTION`, `BOSS_MINION_COUNT`, `STATUS_MAX_STACKS`, `STATUS_TICK_SECONDS`, `MAX_SUSTAIN_MITIGATION`, `MIN_SECONDS_PER_KILL`, and `GOLD_PRESTIGE_CAP` / `prestigeGoldFactor[]` (deleted).

| Constant(s) | Doc | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Offline Efficiency / Offline Cap `BASE_COST` (×2) | `idle-mechanics.md` §4 | Formula shapes locked, no anchor value |
| `K_ATTACK`, `K_DEFEND`, `MEDAL_BASE_WIN`, `MEDAL_BASE_LOSS`, `MEDAL_UPSET_BONUS`, `ARENA_MATCH_BAND_PCT`, `ARENA_SHOP_GEM_PRICE` | `arena.md` | `ARENA_MATCH_BAND_PCT` also a design question, see #2 — set it against GPN's root form (#28, restored 2026-09-16); the flat `GPN_DISPLAY_SCALE` cancels in a ratio, so a percentage band means the same before and after it. `ARENA_SHOP_GEM_PRICE` has an explicit calibration target (under 1 Battle Speed block per day's Medals) |
| `EHP_DEF_CONSTANT` | `global-power-number.md` §2 | Built (#28). At 10 a level-1 Hero's DEF doubles its EHP; tune against how balanced parties should read against lopsided ones |
| `SKILL_COLLECTION_PASSIVE_FRACTION`, `ARTIFACT_COLLECTION_PASSIVE_FRACTION` | none — see #28 | What an unequipped Passive Skill or Artifact gives the Hero, as a fraction of equipping it. 0.1 mirrors Gear; tune together with `GEAR_PASSIVE_COEFFICIENT` so all three collections feel comparable |
| `RAID_BASE_STATS`, `RAID_LEVEL_GROWTH`, `RAID_REWARD_BASE/GROWTH`, `RAID_ENRAGE_SECONDS`, `RAID_RAMPAGE_DMG/POWER_BASE/GROWTH` | `raid-system.md` | Per-raid |
| `SLOT_BASE_BONUS` ×6, `GEAR_PASSIVE_COEFFICIENT` | `gear-equipment.md` §2 | Built. The six slot coefficients are deliberately *identical* — no doc ranks the stats against each other, so six different values would encode a spread nobody decided. `GEAR_PASSIVE_COEFFICIENT` must stay well under them or manual equip stops mattering |
| `SKILL_PASSIVE_MAGNITUDE[]`, `SKILL_ECONOMY_COEFFICIENT` | `skills-gacha.md` §4 | The whole 36-skill magnitude ladder, indexed by rarity. §4 authors it as "small" → "large" and assigns no number anywhere; the *relative ordering* is design content, so retune the set rather than entries |
| `SKILL_POTENCY_PER_POINT` | none — see #18 | What one point of a Skill copy's `(star × 10 + level)` scalar adds to its effect potency. **Identity at minimum**, so §4's authored bands stay the reference and only levelling multiplies up — ×2.18 at 5★/Lv10 on the placeholder. Its own constant rather than reusing `CHAMPION_INVESTMENT_PER_POINT` (×3.95 at max) because a Champion's scalar is its *only* growth axis while a Skill already carries a rarity band |
| `GOLD_BURST_MINUTES[]`, `GOLD_BURST_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `gold-economy.md` §6 | Burst size in minutes of income, and the cadence it repays over. The cooldown is a **decision, not a transcription** — at the shared 6.4s skill base, a 0.5-minute burst repays ~+470% Gold, two orders past §5's ×3 stack target |
| `SKILL_COOLDOWN_REFUND_FRACTION` | none — see #18 | How much shorter a "chance to refund / reset / re-trigger" Active's cooldown is rendered as. One constant for all three such Skills, so the approximation retunes in one place |
| `WEALTH_FACTOR_MIN/MAX`, `WEALTH_NEUTRAL_HOURS` | `skills-gacha.md` §4¹ | The Gambler's Strike family's bounded modulation. §4¹ suggests ×0.5–×2.0 explicitly and calls it not locked; the neutral point is where the factor passes through 1.0 |
| `ARTIFACT_EFFECT_PER_POINT`, `ARTIFACT_ECONOMY_COEFFICIENT` | `artifacts-dig-site-gacha.md` §6 | Per *point* of the investment scalar, unlike Skills' flat magnitude — §6 states the scaling for Artifacts and no doc states it for Skills. See #18's closing note |
| `SKILL_SLOT_BASE_COST`/`_GROWTH`, `ARTIFACT_SLOT_BASE_COST`/`_GROWTH` | `skills-gacha.md` §6, `artifacts-dig-site-gacha.md` §7 | Both mirror the Champion slot track exactly, so all three want deriving together — and all three compete with the two offline tracks for the same Void Shards |
| `GOLD_STEP_BASE`, `BASE_GOLD`, `GOLD_PLATFORM_DISCOUNT` | `gold-economy.md` §3, §3a | **Carry no marker but are open** — see #23.3. `GOLD_TENURE_CEILING` is generated, never tuned by hand: regenerate from `scripts/lib/economy-stages.ts` |
| `SEAL_LADDER_GROWTH[]` | `gold-economy.md` §7 | Set, but calibrated against the superseded Gold anchors — see #23.2 |
| `LOADOUT_SLOT_BASE_COST_GEMS` (8-level doubling) | `loadouts.md` §3 | Built. Two firsts at once, which §3 flags as a genuine unknown: the first time the doubling short-track shape stretches past 5 levels (128× the base at the top), and the first time it is paired with Gems. Now checkable against real Gem income (Trait/Arena sinks exist) |
| `ONLINE_THRESHOLD_MS`, refresh interval | `tech-architecture.md` §9 | |
| `MAX_EVASION` | `classes-and-combat.md` §7 | **Locked at 0.60** — not open, listed for completeness |
| `OVERFLOW_CONVERSION_RATE` | `classes-and-combat.md` §7 | The only crit constant still untuned. Rarely reachable: with LCK off the level curve only a deliberately built crit Hero passes 100% |
| `SEAL_GRANT_PER_BOSS`, `SEAL_GRANT_PER_WORLD_CLEAR`, `SEAL_GRANT_PER_PRESTIGE` | `economy-and-currencies.md` §5 | The milestone batch sizes. Doc gives only the shape — "small per World clear, larger per Prestige" — and defers the values to the world/enemy pass (#6). Built and paying out |
| `VOID_SHARD_BASE`, `VOID_SHARD_GROWTH` | `economy-and-currencies.md` §3 | 100 × 2^prestige, the doc's "starting point". Only has to outpace shop costs, so derive it alongside the slot and offline tracks it pays for — and note that at ~a week per prestige (#22) the first shop purchase is a week in |
| `wealthFactor` clamp range for Gambler's Strike family | `skills-gacha.md` §4 | Suggested ×0.5–×2.0, not locked |
| `CHAMPION_SLOT_BASE_COST`, `CHAMPION_SLOT_COST_GROWTH` | `champions-guild-gacha.md` §1 | Void Shard price of party slots 3→5. Competes directly with the two offline tracks for the same currency, so all three want deriving together |
| `CHAMPION_PASSIVE_PER_POINT` | `champions-guild-gacha.md` §7 | The §7 collection passive. Doc fixes which archetype buffs which stat and states no magnitude anywhere. At 0.002 one maxed Champion is +12% to its archetype's stats, and the full 48-Champion roster maxed (12 per archetype) is +144% on each of the six |
| `CHAMPION_INVESTMENT_PER_POINT` | `champions-guild-gacha.md` §2 | What a copy's `star × 10 + level` scalar is worth. Sets the payoff on dupe levelling, so it decides whether pulling wide or levelling deep is correct |
| Archetype base stat spreads (`ARCHETYPE_DEFINITIONS[].spread`) | `champions-guild-gacha.md` §2 | Not a constant but the same problem: §2 states outright there is no Champion equivalent of the Hero's §2 table, so all four spreads are a reading of the archetype identities rather than a specified number |
| `SEAL_LADDER_BASE_GOLD` | `gold-economy.md` §7 | Doc-specified at 1,000,000. Uncapped per day by design — see the note below |
| `TANK_THREAT_MULTIPLIER`, `TAUNT_THREAT_MULTIPLIER` | none — see #14 | How hard the two documented aggro anchors pull. Any value above 1 already puts a Tank in front of its row-mates; the magnitude only starts mattering once threat becomes contested and continuous |
| `FROSTBIND_STACKS_PER_CAST`, `FROSTBIND_FREEZE_STACKS` | none — see #15 | How fast Frostbind's slow builds and how deep it must get before the freeze lands. Two dials so time-to-freeze can be retuned from either end; a threshold above `STATUS_MAX_STACKS` turns the freeze off entirely |
| The `SKILL_*` magnitude set, `ENRAGE_*`, `KILL_SHOT_CRIT_MULTIPLIER`, `EXECUTE_BONUS`, `FOCUSED_BARRAGE_HITS`, `REVIVE_HP_FRACTION` | none — see #15 | Every ability magnitude in the game. Both rosters describe effects entirely in prose ("a short duration", "a portion", "small") and assign no numbers anywhere. The *relative ordering* is design content and deliberate — wide AoE pays for reach, a pierce beats a basic attack by a little — so retune the set, not individual entries. `HASTE_SPD_BONUS` is excluded: §3 states the doubling |

**On `SEAL_LADDER_BASE_GOLD` — reviewed and closed.** Gold buys nothing in the game except Seals, so this price is the entire Gold sink. The campaign sim banks ~4.9B Gold by prestige 4, which at the base rung and `SEAL_LADDER_GROWTH[champion] = 1.0007` converts to roughly **2,100 Seals in a single sitting** — about two full 1,066-dupe Champions — because `MAX_SEALS_PER_PURCHASE` bounds the per-call size and nothing bounds the per-day total.

**That is intended, and no daily cap is being added.** A player willing to spend an exponentially increasing amount of Gold should be able to keep buying; the ladder's compounding *is* the brake, and it is a smooth one rather than a wall that stops the session dead. Converting a large Gold pile into a large collection is what the pile is for. `SEAL_LADDER_BASE_GOLD` stays an ordinary tuning value in the table above, calibrated at playtest against real Gold income like everything else — not a structural problem to solve first.

## Suggested order

1. ~~**Phase 3 — the remaining three gachas**~~ **Done — `build-log.md` #18.**
2. **Close out the tuning pass** — small, and it should come before anything is built on top of the loop:
   - **Play a session against the tuned loop** and log it in `playtest-notes.md`. The predictions table there is refreshed; session 1 is the only one on record.
   - **Decide the Gold consequences (#23)** — first-week income, the lost calendar anchors, and whether the Seal ladder is re-derived now or after world design. **Measured and half-applied 2026-09-16** (`--report=gold`): the ceiling is regenerated against the measured kill rate, which raises the cap 12× but leaves the walk's income untouched, since it is progression-bound throughout. What remains open is the progression half — `BASE_GOLD` and `GOLD_STEP_BASE` — and #23.2, which is downstream of it.
   - **Confirm the solo shape (#22.1)** — no prestige without a party is a consequence of the design, not yet a stated choice.
   - ~~**Check the cleared-run manual re-engage** flagged in #25.~~ Fixed.
3. **World & Enemy Design (#6)** — names, themes and rosters done 2026-09-15 (closing #5). What remains is art direction and production, and the optional enemy-kit question; kits that change fight length have to be re-measured against #22.
4. **The three remaining quick calls (#1-3)** — all answerable in one short pass, none depend on anything else. #4 (the asset follow-ups) is decided, 2026-09-17.
5. **Phase 4 — endgame systems** (`implementation-plan.md`). Raids, Traits, Arena, Holidays, Battle Speed, plus `loadouts.md` §4's per-raid auto-apply. ~~GPN~~ built (#28); the leaderboard aggregate and Defense GPN remain, with Arena.
6. **Passive Skill Tree (#7)** — the last unbuilt major system; good candidate for its own dedicated session.
7. **Playtest, then tune the rest.** The combat and progression block is tuned (#22); the gacha, shop, economy and ability-magnitude constants are settled here — see the standing-tuning section. The balance script and campaign sim stay in use throughout.

**On the playtest step's position.** Tuning the *remaining* constants wants every system present, so the last step is still the right place to *finish*. But the loop itself was tuned on the sim alone, and `implementation-plan.md` Phase 1's "stop here and actually play it before continuing" has now been overridden three times. The harness (#19) makes a session cheap, and world design is downstream of it — nothing settles how long a world should take like having felt one. That is why step 2 exists.

---

## 🔬 Watch during playtest

Things that are **built and working** but whose *feel* has never been observed against a real session. None of these is a bug or a blocked decision, so none belongs in the lists above — they are the questions only playing the game can answer.

**Raw observations go in `playtest-notes.md`, not here.** This section holds the questions and, eventually, the decisions; that file holds what actually happened. The split matters later: this doc will say *what* was changed, and that one will say *why it felt wrong*, which is the half that normally evaporates. It also carries the sim's falsifiable predictions and the known-inert list, so a session does not burn time re-deriving either.

### Champion rarity modifier — is a Mythic too far ahead of a Common?

`RARITY_STAT_MULTIPLIER` (Common 1.0 → Mythic 2.5) is doc-specified, and taken alone it is a reasonable spread. The thing to watch is that it is **no longer the only thing rarity buys.** As of #12 a Mythic also brings three abilities to a Common's one, and its higher stats shorten its own cooldowns on top of that. Three multiplicative payoffs now ride a single rarity roll:

| Payoff | Source | Common → Mythic |
|---|---|---|
| Stat magnitude | `RARITY_STAT_MULTIPLIER` | ×2.5 |
| Ability count | `RARITY_ABILITY_COUNT` (§2) | ×3 |
| Ability throughput | SPD → `cooldownFor`, emergent | unquantified |

The compounded gap was never the number anyone signed off on — ×2.5 was. Watch for whether a single Mythic pull trivialises a stretch of the run, whether a Common ever feels worth fielding once one Mythic is owned, and whether the gacha reads as rewarding or as a wall you cannot pass without a lucky roll. If it lands too hard, the cheapest lever is compressing `RARITY_STAT_MULTIPLIER` rather than touching ability counts, since the counts carry the kit identity and the multiplier carries nothing but itself.

Worth re-checking specifically **after** the ability-effects pass (#12) lands, since real Support and Control effects will change what a second and third ability are actually worth.

**Status: reviewed, no change.** Left as-is deliberately — the compounding is a plausible design and the alternative is guessing at a correction before anyone has felt the problem. Revisit here, with play data, not before.

### Does a slow wall read better than a hard one?

`MIN_DAMAGE` (#11.5) changed what hitting a wall *looks like*: instead of standing immortal dealing exactly nothing, an outmatched party now chips for 1 and wipes, and the same stage restarts without losing ground. Wall positions did not move.

The open question is purely about feel. A wipe-and-retry loop communicates "you are too weak here" far more clearly than a frozen zero, but it also means the player watches the party die repeatedly, which reads as punishing in a way an idle game may not want. Watch whether the wipe loop is legible or just demoralising, and whether "1 damage" reads as *nearly there* — a misleading signal, since 1 damage against exponential HP is not nearly anywhere. If it misleads, the display is the lever rather than the constant: showing time-to-kill instead of raw damage tells the truth without changing the model.

*(Added 2026-09-15: the tuning pass made both of these more concrete. Boss gates are now the only walls in a party's first prestige, and hero DEF paces enemy PWR exactly, so the `MIN_DAMAGE` chip is now a far-side-of-a-wall reading rather than something normal play shows. Elite wave wipes at the World 1 opening for a solo account are the one place a player will reliably watch the wipe loop.)*

### Is a week-long first prestige the right rhythm? — **new, from #22**

The loop was slowed from hours to about a week for a party of three, and nearly all of that week is idle waiting in front of Stage 5 and Stage 10 gates — fighting is ~3 hours of it. Watch whether the grind reads as anticipation (come back tomorrow, the boss falls) or as a stall, whether players understand *why* they are waiting (the stat breakdown, #26, is the in-game answer), and whether a first Void Shard purchase a week in is too late to feel the prestige shop at all. `XP_PACE_SLACK` is the dial for grind length without touching fight length.

### Do automatic boss fights keep the one moment of attention? — **new, from #25**

Bosses were the only thing that waited for the player. They now fire on their own while the tab is visible. Watch whether a boss still feels like an event when the player did not start it, whether the auto-closing replay is long enough to see what happened, and whether players miss the button.

### Does Gold feel like anything in week one? — **new, from #23**
