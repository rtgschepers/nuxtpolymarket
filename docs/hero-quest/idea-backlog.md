# Idea Backlog — Inclusion Checklist

This is the running idea list from the "Project ideas memory list" conversation, reconstructed here with a checkbox per item. Check an item once you've decided it should move from backlog into a real design doc — unchecked items stay parked exactly as-is.

**Note:** several of these (Global Power Number, Raid System, Passive Skill Tree, Loadouts, Arena) are already referenced as "on the horizon" work in other locked docs (e.g. `tech-architecture.md` §8 defines Global Power Number's computation point, `tech-architecture.md` §4c/4d anticipate Raid and Arena resolution). Checking those here is really about greenlighting the *dedicated* design pass, not introducing them from scratch.

---

- [x] **1. Global Power Number** — ✅ Implemented, see `global-power-number.md` (Locked)
  A single aggregate score that increases with any strength gain — Hero leveling, gacha pulls/upgrades, new Champions added. Purely a flex/vanity stat for now (may gain mechanical purposes later, e.g. matchmaking or difficulty gating). Counts owned Champions even when benched, since they contribute passive stat bonuses regardless of active-party status.

- [x] **2. Raid System** — ✅ Implemented, see `raid-system.md` (Locked)
  Multiple distinct hard bosses, each with a unique mechanic forcing party/setup adjustments. Rewards include gacha pull tokens (other currencies possibly later). Each raid has its own level track — clearing a level unlocks a harder next level with better rewards — with ~~free level selection (not forced linear)~~ **superseded: `raid-system.md` §2 locked a binary farm-or-progress model instead** (best-cleared level, or exactly one higher; older levels aren't individually reachable). Difficulty scaling is fully separate from the main enemy-curve/prestige formula. Attempts: 3/day default (account-wide), banking up to a week's worth at the player's current rate; a prestige-shop upgrade raises both the daily rate and the bank cap together. Quick-clear: once a level's been beaten, instantly claim its rewards without replaying.

- [ ] **3. Passive Skill Tree**
  A tree of purely passive upgrades — flat stat boosts, improved Hero class-path skill effectiveness, increased Gold/XP gain from idle battle. Starts with a generic damage-upgrade root node, splitting into at least 3 paths (one per Hero class path: Warrior/Mage/Archer). Each node has up to 5 levels (effect and cost both scale per level). Purchased with a currency earned from a new, dedicated raid. Hero-only tree, but can include side nodes that upgrade specific Champions/gacha items — never ownership-locked, never allowed to gate a path.
  **Snag resolved:** `raid-system.md` §1 now confirms raids don't have to be gacha-paired — a standalone raid with its own dedicated currency is a valid instance of the raid structure, so this item's "currency earned from a new dedicated raid" premise is structurally sound. **Confirmed as its own separate raid**, not shared with item 8 (Traits).

- [x] **4. Loadouts** — ✅ Implemented, see `loadouts.md` (Locked)
  Save a full party setup as a named loadout and quickly switch between saved ones. Players can set a preferred loadout per raid, auto-applied on entry. **Scope expanded during design to cover everything swappable** (Party + Formation + Skills + Artifacts + Gear, not just party/formation) since those systems didn't exist yet when this item was first drafted. Starts at **2** loadout slots (revised from the original "5"), purchasable up to 10 — priced in **Gems** rather than Void Shards, since loadout slots add no combat power.

- [x] **5. The Arena (PvP)** — ✅ Implemented, see `arena.md` (Locked)
  Players attack with their current live party (optionally pre-swapped via the Loadout system) against other players' asynchronously-resolved, always-AI-controlled `defenseLoadout`. **Snag resolved:** the GPN divergence flagged during GPN's own design is closed by a new Defense GPN, computed off `defenseLoadout` specifically for matchmaking, rather than reusing the attacker's live GPN. **Scope expanded during design** well beyond the original one-line pitch: a refreshable 3-candidate opponent list with a guaranteed-win Training Dummy fallback when the matchmaking pool runs dry, non-banking daily attempts (5 free, purchasable extra on a doubling ladder), asymmetric Elo rating (separate attacker/defender K-factors), a new attacker-only Medals currency spent in a dedicated cross-currency Arena Shop, 2-week seasons with rank-based rewards, a battle log, and its own Rating-based leaderboard separate from the GPN/progression leaderboard.

- [x] **6. Holiday Events** — ✅ Gift-mechanic phase implemented, see `holiday-events.md` (Locked). Gameplay-event content explicitly **not** designed — deferred per your own call mid-session.
  Starts simple: one-off gifts to the player on holidays (e.g. a login bonus/currency drop tied to a date). Leaves room for actual gameplay events (limited-time content) later — that later phase remains fully open, was deliberately not started.

- [x] **7. Gear/Equipment (4th Gacha)** — ✅ Implemented, see `gear-equipment.md` (Locked)
  The 4th gacha for Hero gear — **now the 1st gacha overall** (revised from the original "2nd" note below). One gear piece boosts one stat, one slot per Hero stat — Weapon (PWR), Boots (SPD), Charm (LCK), Gauntlets (IMP), Armor (VIT), Helmet (DEF) — 6 equip slots total, manually equipped with an upgrade indicator. *(The original note had STR/DEX/INT sharing the Weapon slot; those three were later merged into PWR, so Weapon is simply the PWR slot now.)* Owning pieces (not just equipping them) grants a small collection-bonus to stats, same pattern as the Champions passive.

- [x] **8. Traits** — ✅ Implemented, see `traits.md` (Locked)
  A 5th slot-based system, separate from the 4 gachas: **5 trait slots**, each independently rollable for a stat boost (values + rarity tiers TBD — pool incoming next message) drawn from a pool. Rolling costs a currency earned from a new, dedicated raid (not yet named/designed). Individual slots can be **locked** before rerolling, so a locked slot's current boost survives while the rest reroll. Alongside a stat boost + rarity, each roll also lands on **1 of 5 trait Sets**; stacking more Traits of the same Set unlocks additional set bonuses (Set list also incoming next message).
  **Explicitly separate from Loadouts** (`loadouts.md` §1) — Traits get their own dedicated save-slot system, not folded into the existing Party/Formation/Skills/Artifacts/Gear snapshot. Starts at **1** trait save slot, expandable via **Gems** up to **4**. Unlike Loadout save/apply, which is free and unlimited (`loadouts.md` §2), storing or loading a Trait save slot **costs the Trait currency itself** — the explicit intent being to let players freely reroll toward a better combination without losing a locked-in good one, at a real cost to actually bank/restore it.
  **Snag resolved:** `raid-system.md` §1 now confirms raids don't have to be gacha-paired, so this item's "new raid" premise is structurally sound — same resolution as item 3's identical ask. **Confirmed as its own separate raid**, not shared with item 3 (Passive Skill Tree).
  **Stat-boost pool and Set list received** — see dedicated design session (this item now in active design, not just backlog).
  **Awaiting next message:** the stat-boost pool (values + rarity tiers) and the 5 trait Sets + their stacking bonuses.

- [ ] **9. Alternative enemy-scaling formula (smoother stage curve)**
  Candidate replacement for the locked `enemyMultiplier` in `core-progression-and-prestige.md` §1, aimed at smoother difficulty scaling through stages:
  ```
  enemyMultiplier = (prestige × worlds_per_prestige × stages_per_world) × ((world-1) × 10) × stage
  ```
  Not evaluated or compared against the current `5^prestige × 1.6^(world-1) × 1.15^(stage-1)` formula yet — parked here until a dedicated pass (still needs a zero/world-1 and zero/prestige edge-case check, since `(world-1)` and `prestige` are still multiplicative terms that hit 0 at the start of each prestige/World 1).

## Notes
- This doc is a running list only — items move to the relevant locked doc once fully designed and confirmed.
- Checking a box here just marks it ready to design; the actual mechanics still get worked out in their own dedicated conversation/doc, same as every other system in this project.
